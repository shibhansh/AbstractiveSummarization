 i use this with sodastream to make flavored seltzer water and it tastes much better than sodastream 's brand . i have tried the vanilla , orange , and root beer and all have been great . amazon price , especially on subscription is much cheaper than sprouts ; if i recall the cost of 1 was almost double the cost of 2 on amazon .
 giving the chews out , and sit <unknown> . as each is given his chew for the night , he 'll go to his chosen spot and begin chewing on the rawhide . it 's funny to watch , but we know they are each getting enzymes they need and exercise for their teeth and gums . an excellent choice , and sold by our vet , which is the best recommendation i know . we buy ours through amazon because we 've searched the internet time and again , and only here do we find the best price .
 we have been going to a local restaurant that serve this on thursday . everyone we tried just did n't taste right or had very little broccoli . i picked this up one day at our local store . was a little suspect on just adding boiling water to this . what a big surprise . very good soup ! i added some frozen chopped broccoli , simmer . let me tell you we do not make the special trip anymore for cheddar broccoli soup . you 'll be surprise how well it taste .
 i do n't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime , but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough .
 this tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea . the taste is also pretty good . i make mine very concentrated < br / > with less than 3 ounces of hot water and i cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a towel around the whole thing < br / > and let it sit for as long as i can before i drink it .
 coconut water is often a little too salty for me , but this one is sweetened enough to satisfy my sweet tooth . even so , i 've found that it 's better with food or it can get too sweet by the end of the can . it was better with slightly spicy food ( had it with mexican food ) than with , say , a grilled steak . overall , a very good drink . i hope it 'll get <unknown> soon !
 in comparison to other products ( and pure generic <unknown> ' caffeine pills ) , the no fear energy drink offers no better <unknown> < br / > < br / > every energy formula on the market produces a different <unknown> feeling , some are clean and high grade , while others like this one seem full of hype without a super energetic effect. < br / > < br / > finally , in addition to producing a lower energy range , the taste of this formula is not too pleasing .
 when you absolutely must have your peanut butter in liquid form , this brand ca n't be <unknown> < br / > < br / > it was a <unknown> item for <unknown> in our ice cream <unknown> , and it 's perfect for shakes as well . just do n't forget to stir it up first if it 's been sitting there a while .
 i am very happy to have found this cereal . there is no cooking required , i just warm up the milk . best thing however are the ingredients which do not include sugar - just apple and banana flakes to sweeten the cereal . just pure good ingredients . it tastes great on its own , so much so that i happily finish any leftovers . heartier than the typical instant cereals and i honestly feel good about giving it to my child .
 a great product that wal-mart stopped selling . i am certainly glad amazon.com has the <unknown> to supply this product to the people who want and need it .
 i 've tried several varieties and i find the orange the best. < br / > the drink is not sweet , but when served very cold , it 's refreshing. < br / > the only draw back is the product is pricey for the quantity. < br / > < br / > i 'd also suggest the <unknown> competitive product . you get more < br / > product for a better price .
 very happy to find this product online at such a great price . i save at least $ 1.50 per bottle ordering from amazon . there was no change in the taste and quality you expect from torani . anyone who uses sugar-free knows it can be difficult to find the syrups and sometimes even more difficult to find a good selection of flavors . i will defintely continue to buy .
 two of my favorite flavors together . the chocolate is smooth and creamy and the center is a tart sweet combo . the only problem is i ca n't stop eating them until i get to the bottom of the bag and then i have to go buy more .
 i love this salt ! ! the delivery was quick , the price was reasonable and the salt imparts a wonderful flavor to everything i eat ! and , it does n't burn my tongue ! i will be using this salt for ever more !
 i love the plain coconut water no flavors ! i was having leg cramps the were killing me , and coconut water is the best for that ! i also would like to be a sales person for coconut water we do not have it here in the city of <unknown> we do not have it in any of the stores here .
 as i was <unknown> the flowers to a large glass jar , i found a huge clump of hair <unknown> in the flowers . i threw it away along with almost a cup worth of flowers . be careful before placing an order with this company .
 after tasting a bag , i decided to send a variety case to a friend for her birthday . the whole family was delighted and could n't stop raving about how delicious the healthy snacks were .
 these treats are my picky cat 's favorite . i 've tried about 8 different brands in the past and these are always the preferred kind . highly recommended !
 $ <unknown> for <unknown> ounces of water ? you have to be joking . i have to admit it is a beautiful glass bottle ( much better than those <unknown> plastic ones ) , how can you impress your friends drinking out of a plastic bottle ?
 after reading the positive reviews i was tempted to try this . dont consider buying this one or you will regret . it definitely was not fresh and on top of that it did not even taste good . honestly , just not your <unknown> worth .
 i ca n't make a pot of coffee worth drinking . in fact , any coffee that has been sitting in a container tastes off to me . coffee from a stand or cafe is awesome , but expensive . via is a decent single cup of coffee , easy to make , tastes good . drinkable . it 's made from real ground coffee , so that makes it much better than instant . with some cream , i almost think i am having one of those expensive lattes from a coffee stand .
 get rid of them to no avail . i saw this product being reviewed in a gardener 's video blog , and thought <unknown> not ? ' < br / > < br / > within hours those pesky gnats were getting stuck , and over the course of a week , have traps filled with these pests . we 've definitely had a decrease in gnats flying around in our faces when we 're trying to watch tv . now we just need a solution to kill the larvae , so we can end their life cycle completely .
 this is a totally different flavor of reeses ! i tried them a few years ago when they first came out and i have been hooked ! they are the best when they are good and fresh ! i agree with jean - i really do n't like the regular reese 's cups anymore . you simply must try them . the only problem is that it is hard to find them .
 the seller was prompt to respond after i returned the <unknown> < br / > we could not use them because the fragrance was too strong. < br / > can be right for someone else .
 this was about the <unknown> meal i have ever prepared for my family . nobody ate more than a few bites . i love indian food . i love curry , i love chicken . this is really , really bad .
 my daughters pediatrician recommended a b concentrated <unknown> . we like the vegan vitamins because of the minimal ingredient list and the natural ingredients . our daughter loves taking them too . chewy and tasty ...
 like the cheddar potato the best . second in line is the sour cream , and third is the bbq . i recently bought 12 bags of cheddar on amazon ! < br / > these are much better than those baked chips out on the market ( in my opinion ) . oh , and an fyi , these are way better than rice <unknown> keep comparing the two and i totally disagree ) . < br / > the <unknown> oz bag is perfect single size ( pretty generous actually ) . < br / > yummy !
 my tongue hurts . just ate my first haribo gummy bears and now my tongue hurts and has several raised sores on the end of it . shocked , i read the packaging and noticed that they have artificial flavors and colors . yuck . if i 'd known that , i would not have purchased them . i see now that this information is on the amazon website , but i guess i was <unknown> away by all the good reviews and did n't read it carefully enough . ouch .
 powder , natural flavor , citric acid ) , sugar , and annatto ( natural color ) . they contain no fiber nor vitamin a , which i would expect to find in a sweet potato product. < br / > < br / > all in all , the sweet potato popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods . obviously , something along the lines of an apple or some plain popcorn would be a healthier choice for a snack , but certainly would not be as enjoyable !
 i really enjoy this coffee - i have used a variety of the k-cups and this is one of the best .
 loves them , however they do n't love her back . it took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together . finally after a google search , i came across these reviews . i stopped giving her the treats and so far , my cat has been vomit free . buyer beware , this might not happen with every cat , so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly . back to her `` greenies '' i go ! !
 had previously used lavender oil by now . sorry i bought this brand , wo n't do it again . it 's much thinner than anything else i 've used .
 my red velvet cake recipe was costing me about 8 dollars a cake in red food coloring . things were getting out of hand fast . this is saving me a ton of money . a great way to buy food <unknown> < br / > < br / > the product itself gives a beautiful color and does n't seem to impart any additional flavor .
 his house . he forgot that the package was for him , and once he opened it he was delighted to find a weeks worth of these yummy cookies ! normally he would be stocking up on the girl scout thin mints this time of year , but he is delighted to find that keebler has a similar product for so much cheaper and available all year . he is now joking that the serving size is a box instead of a sleeve ! < br / > < br / > apparently these taste amazing with peanut butter .
 great taste , very juicy . few , if any stems . i usually get the <unknown> <unknown> , but my last batch was a little too dried out .
 i love the breakfast blend because it is not real strong and does not have a bitter taste . another great blend is the nantucket blend .
 i had no idea what real <unknown> spice was until now . up to this point i had only purchased supermarket brands which pale in comparison . the minute you see the bottle and open it to smell the spices inside you 'll see what i mean . my corned beef has never tasted so good !
 one of my favorite bold flavors . many of the k-cups are too weak for us , including the flavored varieties . if you like a stronger cup of coffee than this one is for you !
 very happy with it . my husband and i use herbs from it frequently . it produces so much we have had to trim and freeze some of the leaves for later use .
 < br / > 5th bold blazin buffalo wing < br / > 6th blue diamond almonds cinnamon brown sugar < br / > 7th blue diamond almonds lime `n chili < br / > 8th blue diamond almonds smokehouse < br / > 9th bold wasabi & soy sauce < br / > < br / > but that 's just me : you might have a completely different take on these flavors. < br / > 4th and 5th are very close. < br / > < br / > gunner < br / > may , 2012
 san francisco bay coffee fog chaser one cup for keurig k-cup brewers is a very nice complement to the keurig green mountain selections . i am now on my computer with a nice hot cup of the fog chaser at my side . i like the fact that there are eight cups to an air tight bag , and that there is an external plastic container for storage after you open one of these bags . a very nice option which i will again use for future purchases .
 holy barf bag , the jalapeno popchips are foul . i love the original popchips and i really love jalapeno , but for some reason the popchips people just could n't get the flavor right . i tried one , gagged , and handed the bag off to my dad to try . he was munching cautiously when i mentioned i thought they tasted a bit like garbage . he paused , considered , and said , `` that 's it . that 's the taste . there 's something <unknown> about it . '' save your money !
 this tea is great , a contrast in flavor with the strength of black tea and the sweetness of peach good hot or iced .
 to give truvia a shot . perhaps truvia is healthier and more natural , but the taste <unknown> my coffee . it has a slight <unknown> taste which i ca n't stand . i 'm going to try a few other <unknown> sweeteners with the hopes of finding something without an aftertaste. < br / > < br / > edit : just tried truvia and there 's no <unknown> truvia wins , hands down . it 's much more similar to sugar , in both taste and texture . it 's more expensive but well worth the cost .
 these blueberries are delicious . i just wish they sold an alternate version without sugar or oil . blueberries should n't need sugar or , at least , i prefer them that way. < br / > shipping time was reasonably quick . it seemed slow to me just because i was anxious to get them ! < br / > reasonable price , too .
 seeds are excellent and it grows at my <unknown> . it is very easy to grow as long as you have soft surface . you should buy this seeds and cheap too .
 i wish i read the reviews closer before feeding these to my dogs . these are made in china and you can draw your own <unknown> .
 i thought the dinosaur would be an interesting change of pace for my dog . he immediately loved the <unknown> . he loves it . but , he was able to chew the head off in less than a week . the main body is still holding up .
 and it took half the can to get anything like a coffee flavor with the sugars -- cafe vienna is my <unknown> < br / > < br / > now , a heaping spoonful ( or two , but instead of six ) of vienna with a packet of taster 's choice and voila ' , i 'm back in europe ! < br / > < br / > also works with instant <unknown> to take the sugary edge off. < br / > < br / > i 'm defintely buying more when i run out .
 these were pretty good but the 2 oz ones taste better . maybe i just got a bad box of these though . still great protein and energy .
 my parents loved them. < br / > < br / > it is not too sweet and small ! < br / > < br / > when i put in yogurt and pancake , it 's my <unknown> !
 i live in the south and must be honest when i say that this tea is much better than even the local restaurants can make . it is sweet without being overly <unknown> . i did find out that i have to stir it a little more than i would a regular cup of tea that is warm . but , that is probably to be expected . it is good !
 the coffee is ok , nothing special . i will like to find this product at a better price .
 this coffee is about what you might get at your local 7-11 or <unknown> gas station . not <unknown> good ... and not what i would consider premium coffee . if you normally drink folgers or maxwell <unknown> this a try. < br / > if starbucks is more your <unknown> something else .
 tastes like regular pasta - much better than the <unknown> versions from other brands . much more filling than regular pasta because of the quinoa .
 a coworker brought this <unknown> into the office and i am so greatful . i am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my `` much yum '' category .
 all of a sudden this tea is no longer on the supermarket shelves . luckily i was able to get it on amazon. < br / > i will buy more since i think this is the best tasting tea there is and i do n't have to add lemon which causes too much acid in my system . this tea is smooth , not bitter and i will not drink any other tea .
 i love this powdered peanut butter . my boyfriend and i are peanut butter freaks so we were a little skeptical . it takes exactly like regular peanut butter but with out all the fat and calories . i use it with my body by <unknown> shakes to make the chocolate peanut butter cup recipe.. but you can use it anywhere you would normally use regular peanut butter .
 not worth the price ! ! ! has a very bitter taste ! ! ! ! ! you have to add a ton of honey to it to make it worth a damn . does not help coat the throat in anyway ! ! ! ! ! !
 all of the potential my hair has ever had ! '' but it was n't bad . my biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent . i 'm not sure how to explain it , but the scent seems a little chemical to me . it reminds me of a very faint version of the way your hair smells after a <unknown> < br / > < br / > this product is n't so bad that i wo n't eventually finish the bottle , but it 's not something i plan on purchasing in the future .
 one sells it for 5.99 , yet the warehouse <unknown> that is the retail price . am i missing something here ? how many hundreds of dollars have i wasted ? ? ? i guess it is a matter of what the market will bear ... <unknown> ! of course there is the additional shipping <unknown> on principal alone i will give up on this product . the greed is beyond <unknown> < br / > < br / > i gave the product a low rating , even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly overpriced .
 i think the taste was great , the ingredients are premium ingredients , and they are extremely easy to carry around . the only reason i did n't give 5 stars were because i feel like they should have fewer nuts . other than that , i love them ! : )
 please do not send the salmon as baby will no eat it , please send the chicken on happybaby organic baby food . i am to received this once a month. < br / > < br / > <unknown> <unknown>
 this fruit and nut bar by kind is very , very tasty . travels well , even in the heat . no problem with melting or not being able to handle due to the heat . nuts do require chewing so would not recommend them to anyone with chewing issues ... otherwise , they are superb .
 the belts themselves have a really off putting plastic flavor that comes as a part of the watermelon flavoring . if you get it you 'll know what i mean . none of the other sour power belts have this taste , it literally tastes like plastic and watermelon perfume compressed themselves into a belt and rolled in sour power powder. < br / > < br / > i love sour power as much as everyone , but next time i buy a huge tub ( probably quite soon ) , it 'll be of any other flavor .
 ) to enjoy it . i did not like the aluminum can for this product either . i find that <unknown> drinks seem to <unknown> onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks. < br / > < br / > my personal preference was for the black cherry , but others may like the kiwi berry . i ca n't recommend this as a net positive , but my preferences might adversely reflect here - i 'll rate it as neutral . if you feel your tastes are similar to mine , you should probably <unknown> this one .
 a lot of reviews , but this bread is just outstanding in every way . this <unknown> does n't feel or taste low carb , and it made some really good french toast . the shipping cost is high ( i chose expedited ) , but maybe if i buy enough at a time next order and freeze it i can make it less costly ... but lets face it , good bread that is low carb is worth every penny to those of us that must watch the carbs , but love bread . well done , folks .
 my girl ( amber ) just loves her <unknown> <unknown> where i keep them and lets me know when she wants one .
 why eat regular potato chips , when you can eat pop chips . the bbq flavor gets boring pretty quickly , so do n't eat a whole lot in a few days .
 these are about $ 1.50 to $ 2.50 in the store , so i was pleased to find them on subscribe and save for $ 1.50 each or cheaper . good quality , sturdy enough to toss in a purse or backpack , and pleasantly sweet without being overwhelming . good substitute for candy when i want a treat . filling enough to hold me several hours when i 'm on the go .
 i 've tried a lot of the sobe <unknown> and have to say blackberry grape is my favorite . the others seem to have very light flavors , like drinking water . but this one is very flavorful .
 based in houston , texas makes this awesome black bean dip . it is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it . i am not sure why in dallas tx it 's so hard to find - maybe because <unknown> has so many good flavors ? ? ? i make the traditional <unknown> dip with this instead of the refried beans , and am thinking about creating a breakfast <unknown> with this and some <unknown> sauce . try it , it 's not too too spicy but is very good !
 combination of spices , including cinnamon , ginger , allspice , nutmeg , clove , and cardamom . the combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy ( not as spicy as regular chai tea ) . you can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai , but i prefer to drink it plain , as i think it 's perfect as is . finally , the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes stash chai green tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day -- highly recommended !
 i purchased <unknown> gourmet popcorn , pecan & <unknown> caramel corn , 8-ounce bags ( pack of 6 ) for a gift i was sooo <unknown> it was so stale no one ( even the kids ) could or would eat it . you can not return it so i am out the money . do not purchase ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
 i think these are a bit boring ( i like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably <unknown> ) but they do <unknown> taste like peas , and my toddler begs for them ( `` peas ! peas ! '' ) . i suspect she likes the crunchiness . i bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi-pack today . i think they 'd probably be good in homemade trail mix , too .
 i 'm a meat eater , my wife 's vegetarian . she picked some of this veggie burger mix up to try , and we both really like it ! i 'm not saying it tastes like beef , but i do n't believe it 's supposed to . it 's really good ! and i 'd recommend it to anyone : )
 saw it at <unknown> . at there unlike amazon it was only $ 3.00 . it was worth buying after i tryed it out . taste like a fortune cookie with vanilla filling inside of it . love it and yes would highly recommed .
 to be vets to help them go through school . then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness . read the back of the labels of hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers , bones , unwanted organs from animals , basically all of the stuff we would n't eat . please try another brand like orijen or evo . your cat will thank you .
 the coconut water i received was exactly as expected . packaging could have been a little bit better as the bottles were all loose in the box .
 few tries but she is very food motivated and now can empty one in about an hour or so . the advice to fill it more than half full on the first go is good . in all , i like this toy , because it 's harder and requires more time and effort from a dog that the typical treat dispenser , which is good if you want to give you dog something to occupy her . if you are looking for a first <unknown> toy , i would recommend getting the twist n treat first , however .
 i did like this product until some jars i found black mold on the inner <unknown> < br / > < br / > i read other reviews , but i thought it must 've been a bad batch . i was wrong. < br / > < br / > earth 's best used to be very good . so i canceled my next subscribe and save order . then i feedback cancel reason to amazon .
 we must have this tea now ... keep a pitcher in the fridge at all times . it is a great way to get your green tea in everyday , and is refreshing with a heavy meal .
 > even my little chihuahua , cookie , does great on it . beautiful , soft and full coat , nice teeth , breath , stool and overall health. < br / > < br / > i do feed this as 70 % of their overall diet , the other 30 % being from the honest kitchen ( <unknown> and love formulas ) . < br / > < br / > this is a food i 've happily recommended ! and i do n't see myself feeding anything else . pleased with the customer service as well !
 gold bears are just what you get . these are great gummy bears . i plan on buying them again .
 we have been on gluten free for a few months now , and when you first start , many things are hit or miss . i do n't usually like vanilla `` oreo '' type cookies anyway , and worried that my boys ( 6 and 4 years old ) would never go for them ... <unknown> they are so sweet , <unknown> , and delicious that our whole family ( my husband included ) could n't get enough of them. < br / > buy these cookies , for real .
 as with most of the reviews here my tins arrived with 75 % or more of the wafers crushed . we ended up using a spoon to eat the crumbs of the 1st tin we opened . <unknown> delicious but i can not imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you can not avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available . what a mess . if these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2 .
 i 've tried unsweetened , shredded coconut from various health food stores , etc . this is the best & much cheaper than at health food stores .
 i purchased these `` dried blueberries '' , but they are n't what i expected . the blueberries are coated with sugar and sunflower oil . they are really <unknown> < br / > < br / > while the price was attractive , i feel this product is mislabeled . it should be labeled , `` candied dried blueberries '' .
 hoping for a fruity flavor , but instead it tastes just like cough syrup . i do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child , so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine , i can not drink it . i tried to drink it anyways , thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor , but i just could n't do it ! well , that is just my 2 cents . if anyone else has tried this and agrees with me , let me know !
 it makes me happy to get out of bed and have my sumatra coffee . when you brew this coffee , it has a `` head '' on it when it comes out of the keurig spout , it is just like the smell at the <unknown> store , and also has that very fresh taste . i have found that most of the kcups are either crazy weak , or just too acidic for my taste ... i swear , thank goodness <unknown> finally got in the kcup game . no , i do not work for <unknown> .
 i 've had some good <unknown> <unknown> in my day , but nothing does the trick like these candies . perfect for <unknown> and the best gift for the family <unknown> <unknown>
 begin coughing , so they are n't something i 'll be continuing to eat . but for most people , that would n't be a problem . you can even use them to grow sprouts if you 'd prefer something more <unknown> . those who grow the sprouts say that they make tiny little sprouts , but good to eat . i grew a `` chia pet '' years ago , but do n't remember what the sprouts looked like . i do remember that they sprouted easily , so that should n't be a problem for <unknown> <unknown> .
 popchips are the bomb ! ! i use the parmesan garlic to scoop up cottage cheese as a healthy alternative to chips and dip . my healthy eating program is saved .
 these gave me a headache , too much sugar , and other ingredients that did n't sit well . i would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier .
 the quality of this brand was very very good . i really enjoyed three of the six but the other three were bland . the three i liked were a little less spicy then i would eat but made for the <unknown> ... . i bought a 6 pack the the kidney bean curry and spice it up to my liking and it 's great .
 <unknown> with no refined carbs ! hallelujah ! good texture , takes on flavor of sauce , quick shipment . this is a great option for adding to an <unknown> dish . will re-order .
 , or an aggressive <unknown> < br / > < br / > definitely do not leave your dog alone with the toy . ( this should go without <unknown> ... ) < br / > < br / > would i recommend the toy ? maybe . i think it would be ideal for medium sized dogs that are n't too smart for their own good . ( if your dog can unscrew things , open doors , <unknown> , <unknown> you may want to go for a more challenging toy . i wish i had of . )
 tastes like regular wheat pasta . my kids love all their varieties of pasta , especially the spaghetti .
 the pepper is great ! ! plan on using it to keep squirrels off of <unknown> , but will try it for cooking also . price was great . one note though , product is pictured in a jar and although it says packaging may be different , it should say sold in pouches somewhere . i thought i was getting a jar .
 such a great tea , glad to see it on amazon since my local grocers do n't carry it . totally agree with the other reviewers about how yummy it is. < br / > i love it iced , but my <unknown> likes it hot when he visits .
 found these at a local store called <unknown> . really really wonderful cookies for tea or coffee , or when you just want a whole grain cookie with real substance , not too sweet and with a fruity chew when you bite into a <unknown> . the chocolate ones are my favorite , but i cant find them much anymore .
 i purchased this sauce as it is the exact same sauce used at the hot sauce bar of <unknown> <unknown> ( http : <unknown> ) . it goes amazing with steak <unknown> but in my home cooking , it works wells as a marinade and as a condiment .
 these chips are outstanding ! ! use in place of tortilla chips with salsa , and you will never go back . forget the fact that they are healthy , these chips are delicious !
 these are my husband 's favorite kind of skittles and we ca n't find them in stores anymore . thanks for making christmas a little sweeter .
 i discovered this salsa on a trip to costa rica . many of the restaurants in costa rica use <unknown> salsa in the dishes they prepare . it was also available as a condiment everywhere like salt and pepper . i was excited to see i could buy it here in the states . i mostly use in <unknown> dishes i cook but it adds great flavor to just about everything . i recommend this salsa 110 % you will not be sorry .
 i 've always wanted to like coconut water - low in calories , high in minerals - but i 've just never liked the taste much . the pineapple juice in this really makes a difference . it still needs to be well chilled to be good , but it makes a healthy post-workout drink .
 this is the only english breakfast tea on the market that <unknown> its <unknown> it is full bodied , rich , and flavorful . earl grey tastes like perfume and the majority of others are thin and lack the depth this has . have no fear , drink here .
 honey <unknown> have replaced them as my new number one ! they do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these. < br / > < br / > price wise ... i do not see that they are that much of a deal here . i purchased them for $ 2.99 at the grocery with no shipping . i would have given the product 5 stars ( easily ) had it not been for the price . the taste is fabulous -- you wo n't be disappointed .
 package , you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness . having said that , in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your keurig brewer . the 36 count boxes arrived as <unknown> brown cardboard boxes , not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon . inside each cardboard box , there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags , each of which holds 12 of the pods . the bags are not resealable !
 after researching dog foods , i went with wellness core and my little dog loves it ! ! i feed wellness core and put 1/2 can of the canned in with it and am so pleased that my dog begs for `` mealtime '' .
 my dog tends to get stomach problems if he 's fed non-organic food , so i 'm careful to always buy him organic ( he probably eats better than i do ) . he snarfed up these treats readily and clearly enjoyed them , with no resulting tummy troubles that we saw .
 this trap is by far the worst gopher trap i have ever purchased . the trap does not engage . in order for me to get my credit , i would lose more headaches than <unknown> else . save your money .
 i agree with some of the comments stating that it is a bit thin , and not really bbq flavored . however , i do use this more as a condiment , instead of <unknown> or 57 sauce - for that purpose , with zero cal , carbs , etc ... it is an awesome product ! : d i also really enjoy the flavor . but taste is completely individual . it is def . worth a try if you are watching carbs or looking for easy places to cut a few calories from your diet . : )
 this is one of my favorite k-cup flavored coffees . not too light , it has this sweet , delicious aroma . everytime i brew a cup someone will complement that coffee smells really good ! : )
 believe i ordered this product late yesterday afternoon , & received it today ! and ... ..i ca n't believe how incredibly fantastic it tastes -- <unknown> the powder by itself . and lastly -- -- -it 's only 1 ww point per 2 tablespoons . double wow ! now , i ca n't wait to try the chocolate. < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > powdered peanut butter - 85 % less fat and calories - 2 pack - <unknown> each - free bonus pb2 recipe cards included ( 17 cards in total ) < /a >
 the breakfast in bed coffee from wolfgang puck is a good medium roast coffee . my husband , the regular coffee drinker of our house , likes it , but feels he would like the coffee more if it were a bit stronger . the product arrived quite soon after ordering .
 i have had this since childhood and was n't sure if anyone from the mainland would enjoy it until i gave it as a gift one day among other things `` hawaiian '' . < br / > < br / > my <unknown> were converted on the spot ! i am not a licorice fan and was surprised to see it in the ingredients , but this does not taste like black licorice at all .
 my son loves this product - it is healthy , convenient ( packaging ) and since he refuses all other greens we 've tried , this is a good way to encourage him to eat green veggies . the one drawback is that the price is on the high side . i am now wondering if it is worth the value , and will probably try other alternatives if price continues to go up .
 have bought these in the past with no issues . i have 4 labs and they love the rawhide bones . however this last package made < br / > every one of my dogs very very sick . both the young and old got really sick . will not buy theses again !
 i used to buy these around christmas time for this little produce store where i lived . then i moved for college and have n't been able to find these anywhere and i could n't remember the exactly name so i end up here on amazon searching for them and found them . i loved these candies and takes a handful in my backpack or purse with me .
 best energy bar ever ... healthy , tasty , & less than 4 ingredients . what could be better than that . great taste too .
 tried a couple of samples i took home from an expo . loved the sustained energy it gave while i cleaned my house . no <unknown> , headache or energy crash like i usually get from coffee . really helped me with <unknown> .
 i remember eating mallomars as a child , but have never seen them in the supermarkets in recent years so it was a great pleasure to obtain them through the vine program . they taste as good now , 50 years later , as they did when i was 10 . wonderful <unknown> , smooth chocolate made it hard to stop eating after the first two , but calories do count so i asked a friend to keep them in her apartment so i could n't eat the entire box .
 did n't taste like dessert or have chocolate in it that could melt . these seemed simple and are advertised as chunky peanut butter . nowhere in the description , title or picture on the package did it mention chocolate . i now have a box of protein bars that i cant ' take hiking with me , because they melt. < br / > < br / > i 'd rather find a simple gluten-free , high-protein bar that i could eat in the morning without the chocolate . seems impossible to find . i was very disappointed .
 never buy pedigree . i made a huge mistake trying this . it has the nutritional value of a cardboard box . it 's full of corn and by-products . your dog deserves better than this . if i could give pedigree a <unknown> , i would . my dog 's coat is softer and shinier and she 's much more energetic on another brand . there 's dog food info all over the net . please , steer clear of the ugly pedigree .
 its more expensive than the rest but let me tell you ... <unknown> quality , easy to clean , to use and works great cuz i have the meals ready to go ... <unknown> preserved
 those that say these peppers are not hot must eat this stuff a lot , or just have no sense of heat . everyone i let try these have said these peppers are crazy hot . i would not eat them straight out of the package because they can get stuck to the back of your thought and cause some trouble .
 < br / > i recently purchased a keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea . i only drink it iced , perhaps that is the difference ? two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice ( using the large cup setting ) . poured over ice with a bit of milk . i use stevia for my sweetener. < br / > < br / > no bitterness . just perfectly brewed aromatic chai tea . with the double spice , it gives my tastebuds the perfect `` kick '' that i desire .
 i love the flavor of this tea . i 'm not sure it whether it has helped my memory or focus to any significant degree . when i drink a tea like tazo 's focus , i get a great focused feeling that does n't give me a crash . i was hoping this would do something like that , but it has n't ( probably because it has zero caffeine ) .
 these are great for your dogs teeth . recommended by my vet . she loves them ! ! ! try them . your dog will love them too .
 that does not appeal to all. < br / > < br / > i only wish that this product was sold in smaller quantities . i only use about a tablespoon of chicory per pot of coffee . the <unknown> if used by ' date on the product i received was for six months into the future . there is no way i can see myself using up all six bags by then . it is still a very good value. < br / > < br / > enjoy. < br / > < br / > <unknown>
 great product . does not completely get rid of hot flashes and night sweats , but seriously reduces their number and intensity . i tried everything else and this is the only thing that made any difference . i now get reasonable sleep at night .
 being in a thermos for a number of hours it retained it 's flavor and aroma . if you like a strong , rich blend this is the coffee for you . by using the recommended amount you will end up with a strong , rich , flavorful cup of very good coffee . the fine grind is a nice touch and gives one the feeling that all of the ground beans are being used . definately a vast improvement over the usual store varieties . give it a try and chance 's are it will grow on you .
 this is a great product . my dogs love them . in fact they will fight over who gets one first . the teenies are the perfect size . it is one of the few treats i can safely offer my smallest yorkie . they both seem to listen very well when i pull out the bag. < br / > < br / > my vet says that for yorkies they both have very little plague . it beats trying to use the small <unknown> to brush their teeth .
 . i saw dr. oz introducing new foods to some people one day and he reminded them to taste and evaluate on the item , not as a comparision to what they were used too . that may be why some folks do not like these . i love these so much i 'm buying in bulk . but i have changed my eating habits 180 degrees so maybe that 's why i love them . i never go back to the old way i ate as comparision , and have no lingering <unknown> for the junk food flavor .
 just awful ! i thought food was supposed to taste good ! i had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth , it 's that bad .
 my dogs love this food , yes if you buy it at amazon it 's a few bucks more expensive , but its fast and you do not have to drive to petco . food is great and allergy free ! dogs love it
 my dogs all seem to love these and will choose them over other treats . they have the added bonus of being fortified with glucosamine and chondroitin which are great for my aging dog 's hips and joints . these are the best value that i 've found for these and with subscribe and save , they are even a better deal !
 had to get a tea ball for the loose tea . this is for a true tea <unknown> who can appreciate the art of making tea . clearly , this tea being organic , the tin being so decorative , and the purchase <unknown> <unknown> a specific tea growing region allows certain tea <unknown> to have a mental appreciation for the background of the tea while drinking it. < br / > i drink earl grey as a pick me up in the afternoon . this one is comparable in taste to other earl greys on the market .
 new one , and was delighted when i found it on amazon ( both versions were shown as available ) . my cat has a health problem that requires this specific food . i compared the ingredients , the label , and all the details for a match before i placed the order . i was very careful . when i received the cat food , it was the new recipe ( not what i wanted ) . apparently , the old recipe is not available at all anymore , so the item should be removed from the website .
 so yummy my kids love them . best natural cookie i have ever had , just like <unknown> of nana 's cookies are very good and shipping was fast .
 my dog likes this product . that is most important . it does n't have a foul odor ... the description says you can break it in pieces ... you can but it is a bit dry and pieces do n't come off in the same size consistently . overall i would recommend .
 the other reviews are correct . i would definately not apply this over night . i 'm wanting it now for <unknown> , which i usually salt cure for as much as 24 hours . i guessing that this marinade would turn a <unknown> into a <unknown> . if you can find this <unknown> it is the bomb . i highly suggest following the instructions the first time just so you know what it does . i more the doubled the time and almost had baby food . great stuff and i want it ! time to call <unknown> !
 but i 'm happy to say , my dog loves this stuff . i do n't even need to add leftover meat scraps or gravy sauce like i did to his old food . this stuff is way better than the crap they sell at those chain stores . ca n't beat the price with s & s ! also love that they come in smaller resealable bags which keeps the food fresh . better to open up a brand new bag every couple weeks than to leave a huge opened bag of kibble in the pantry for months .
 i eat all kinds of oatmeal <unknown> , flavored , instant , steel cut - and this is by far my favorite . the oats are n't sad little flecks and the blueberries are whole and real . the texture is great chewy but not tough and the taste is great <unknown> oat taste that is not overwhelmed by sweetness . i also like that the pouch has a water measuring line on it. < br / > < br / > i 've tried every oatmeal from this brand that my store carries and i like them all .
 great for small breeds . high in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use . less waste results from the high quality ingredients . i have been hunting , training , showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years , with multiple national champions . i have been highly satisfied with eukanuba 's quality and the results i have obtained feeding their foods . my recent purchases are with wag , through amazon.com . their prices are the best i have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock .
 i received this tea as a birthday gift . i generally do n't like teas with `` odd '' flavors -- i do n't like stuff like cinnamon , lemon , rose hips , or orange rind in my tea . this was just lovely . the smell and flavor is light and pleasant , and the tea bags were of a nice quality . i recommend this tea !
 i really like the way they taste , i like the fact that these bars are chewy they really fill you up . i am going to try another flavor next time , because i liked these so much !
 this item is very poor . it came very damaged with multiple packs missing from the `` <unknown> '' promised . it came with no packaging whatsoever , just the box seen in the picture with an address <unknown> on the side . the entire box was covered in tape as if it had been opened before and it seems a little more than coincidental that packs happened to be missing .
 i have tried various <unknown> 's and k-cup for years . i must say that <unknown> blend is probably one of the best coffee . it 's rich , but smooth . without a doubt , i plan on ordering <unknown>
 i bought two boxes to be <unknown> on mother 's day . both were received as stale , dry product . very disappointed and <unknown> .
 okay . maybe it 's not the best ever , but it is good enough to keep my grandkids screaming for more . pops very nicely . smells good . tastes good .
 my son started on this the minute it got here . was neat to see them both so interested .
 great flavor and strong on the largest size ( sports mug ) that i take in the car . great value and a quality product .
 noodles in boiling water for the amount of time listed on the package . i always set a timer and do not rely on `` trying it '' like i used to with semolina pastas . when the timer goes off test the pasta and set timer for another minute if needed . i never have to cook longer than the time listed on the bag . the pasta holds shape perfectly and is an awesome addition to our gluten free pantry . i love the gluten free variety offered by tinkyada and the amazing prices offered on amazon.com !
 my son hates being sprayed ( bug or sunscreen spray ) . he spends most of his day outside at daycare and <unknown> find him very sweet . now that west <unknown> has become such an issue here , i am <unknown> on making sure he is covered . these wipes ( along with <unknown> bands ) have worked perfectly . i just wipe him down as he is having breakfast every morning and he is set for the day .
 / > < br / > if you 're the crunchy type ( and i am ) , you 'll be glad to know that love crunch is certified organic and has a very clean ingredient list . i 'd love it even more if the bag were recyclable / <unknown> and the chocolate were fair trade , but am happy to find that nature 's path donates to food <unknown> for every bag purchased , up to $ 1 million . i 'm not usually a big granola eater , but i 'd happily buy more love crunch .
 but they are also washed with <unknown> . ( i can tell because of the <unknown> , golden color ! ) < br / > < br / > <unknown> , <unknown> , queen and <unknown> -- they 're all here in buttery <unknown> ! < br / > < br / > so if you 're in the mood for a fantastic butter cookie , you will love <unknown> from pepperidge farm . ( and if your favorite <unknown> or student loves <unknown> -- and cookies -- this would make a great addition to any care package ! )
 my dogs eat this stuff like its candy ... <unknown> candy for dogs . got here fast but you got ta be there ... <unknown> cause the dogs in the neighborhood would steal it .
 these were so good . they tasted like oatmeal cookies with coconut . they are rather small and for the price that might not fly with some people . but you pay for healthy these days .
 we love lara bars at our gfcf house . lemon is a favorite of my 4 year old !
 kettle brand chips used to be so good ... oily , crunchy , flavorful . i suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse . now they 're no better than any other big name brand chip . try the good health kettle style olive oil chips instead . they are as good as the kettle brand once was . r.i.p. , kettle brand chips . : (
 <unknown> starbucks girl for years , and now that i live in a town without <unknown> use my keurig daily . i do n't like strong or dark coffees , so this one is nice and mild for me . i also use fat-free , flavored creamers and they taste great with this coffee blend . i also love getting this shipped to me fast on amazon . the boxes that i found at walmart , <unknown> 's , etc ... had less kcups in them . i find that ordering them online via amazon is a great value !
 light and crisp - wonderful flavor , but not many cookies in the package . i will buy again
 in a sauce pan and simmer it until the apples are soft . serve it warm . omg ! it 's good. < br / > i 've also tried the warm mix with a splash of peach <unknown> and a dollop of whipped cream added right before serving and the flavor blew me away . all of our dinner guests have given it rave reviews. < br / > < br / > the next thing i 'm going to try it in is whipped cream - i 'll come back and let you know how that goes .
 sam 's <unknown> sale <unknown> same product for under $ 40 per 80 count . so , i will not purchase this product < br / > at $ <unknown> per count plus <unknown> .
 it is n't a rubbery <unknown> < br / > < br / > so , overall we are happy with the bone . our dog loves it ( a little too much when we find it in our bed ) and it has lasted a while . we 'll probably buy another one when it 's gone . it is just unfortunate that it is so <unknown> at <unknown> < br / > < br / > hope this was helpful . leave a comment if there are any questions i can answer about this bone . thanks !
 're quite wonderful for dunking and nibbling , letting the cookie part dissolve away so that the <unknown> nuggets remain to be chewed . not very sweet , which i also like in a cookie . kids are n't going to go for these , which is great -- more left over for you , while they gobble the oreos . we really liked these , and will buy them again . a classy biscuit , reminiscent of england ( and the `` biscuits '' we used to get up in canada ) -- cookies for adults . recommended !
 mentioning the sugar addition , which makes me wonder if the positive reviews were generated by <unknown> people . the page for this product makes no mention of the actual ingredients ; similarly their web site has no ingredient listing . i thought this meant the coconut water was just that , coconut water . the taste is , yes , sweet -- so sweet my teeth hurt from drinking the beverage ! this is just soda pop masquerading as coconut water . not for me -- i 've dumped the contents of all the cans down the sink .
 i promise that this oil smells like bacon . i just received my order today and opened it to use , i put a small drop in my palm and began to rub them together to apply it to my face and no way ... <unknown> how ... .it smelled like bacon . i buy coconut oil all the time and it never smells like this ! i am soooo very disappointed in the quality of this product ... .i want a refund ! ! ! !
 / > < br / > i do n't use it for skin care though have tried it . it is oily and i do n't like <unknown> around in my clothes ( or out of them either ) so i use regular skin care stuff for that. < br / > < br / > i am a <unknown> of <unknown> oil and am introducing my friends to it along with instructions on where to find it . oh , by the way , it makes good gifts for the somebody who has everything or for the hostess .

 several times to get my jack russell terrier to use this treat , but he prefers chewing on something rather than licking his treats . the only treat he has patience with licking is a little cup of doggie ice cream . even ice cubes he will crunch instead of lick . i was also a little bit bothered by the smell of the product ; there was an oily odor to it . this treat may work for little dogs or dogs who have more patience but sadly not my dog . it is a good <unknown> though .
 first time i have order coffee from amazon . tully 's house blend is a very good brand , has a good <unknown> was delivered to my house two days before amazon said that it would be here , that was great . will be ordering again from here shortly .
 i found this tea to be excellent . the only reason for the 4 stars , instead of 5 , was that i had to resort to a shop <unknown> and a wrench to get one of the 3 containers open . there is such a thing as too well sealed !
 this very crispy sugar wafer is perfect with ice cream , or with coffee or tea . it 's got a lovely burnt marshmallow flavor . i really like <unknown> they seem to <unknown> with anything . i 'm allergic to gmo cornstarch , so it is hard for me to find cookies i can eat . this one is lovely , and it 's safe for me to eat .
 i really like the cheese flavored , but usually end up throwing out the pretzel ones . it makes for an expensive snack , but the cheese ones are sooooooo good !
 this is as close to earl grey perfection as one can hope from a tea bag , and at ~ $ <unknown> , an incredible value . for those who take no issue with tea in a bag , stash 's <unknown> offering provides a balance of floral , citrus , and earthy notes without being overly tannic or bitter . if you 're in the us and you 've been looking for a substitute for <unknown> , this is it .
 . newman 's special blend arabica coffee for me leaves nothing to be desired ; taste , aroma , boldness and ease of preparation make this a daily morning must have . i would certainly recommend that if you are a coffee lover , that you give it a try . i think it 's the best thing since sliced bread . and amazon is the way to go , i order when i 'm running low and it is at my doorstep the following day . really , i do n't see how anyone can ask for more .
 this arrived at least a week late with no refrigeration . upon opening the package , i found it was warm and smelled a bit strange . i would have sent it back , but it was <unknown> up my home and had to be disposed of . as for a refund , i 'm still wondering if i want to <unknown> with the <unknown> who sent it . it took them long enough .
 but these chips are great . the crunch is just right , plus they have just the right amount of salt . not to salty not too bland . they are a little oily but that 's ok . the best thing is the 2 oz package . when i buy a larger bag it 's harder to resist eating them all . this 2 oz package allows for a little `` portion control '' . be sure to use your scissors to open , 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and do n't open easily . enjoy !
 this has got to be a new drink that will finally give coke a run for its money in my house . i can not believe or describe how good it is . it makes the standard run of the mill black cherry drinks pale by comparison . my only complaint is that it did n't come in a 12 ounce can !
 this is one of very few dog foods at my local walmart that lists beef as the first ingredient . most of the others are made primarily from corn meal . i 'm no dog food expert , but i would think that 's a definite plus . it is not the cheapest food you can buy , but the price is on the low end , especially when compared to small bags of premium brand dog food . the bits are <unknown> for small breeds and my 10 pound dog has no trouble at all .
 absolutely love ella 's kitchen pouches . the sweet potato , pumpkin , apples and blueberry one is my <unknown> son 's favorite , although my <unknown> loves it as well . i wish i had discovered them sooner . squeeze into a bowl for spoon feeding or let your little one drink directly from the pouch . they 're convenient and healthy - highly recommend !
 was on a business trip . i used amazon prime to overnight this to the friend that was taking care of her . he switched her over to this food , and she stopped <unknown> < br / > < br / > she has been happy with this food for 6 months , which is a long time for her . being able to get anytime , anywhere is a big plus for me. < br / > < br / > it 's also a nice round shaped food , which works well with automatic cat <unknown> .
 i have the <unknown> popcorn machine with kettle . i have used 10 packs of the popcorn out of the 24 pack case . the taste of the popcorn is great , but at least 25 % of the popcorn does not pop . the kernel <unknown> is half full of unpopped kernels after each batch . i will try other brands because to me that is just too much unpopped kernels .
 movie <unknown> < br / > i have the 4 oz . elite <unknown> <unknown> that i purchased a couple of years ago from costco <unknown> < br / > i can only guess that the people that are complaining about this product do not have the correct equipment or are not letting the popcorn maker preheat ? < br / > the popcorn is a little salty , but so is the movie theater type . so if you do n't want it salty , just do n't cut open the seasoning portion of the three part package .
 instant coffee . i am <unknown> <unknown> allows this stuff to be sold ! it is disgusting . amazon should remove this from their site .
 an excellent syrup with robust flavor . not only is this great on pancakes , but it is also superb for use in candies & <unknown> . the grade b flavor much more readily shows through than the grade a <unknown> < br / > < br / > the only downside is that i am going through it too quickly !
 they 're not quite as bold as you might hope . i mean -- i 'm from texas . bold should be really bold . but they are good -- so we 'll just overlook it . yummy. < br / > < br / > and they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of b vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake . but they 're good enough that it 's not exactly an <unknown> test whether you 'll want to eat them .
 i 've been using this ghee for years now and can say that it 's hands down the best . the quality is <unknown> . i 've spoken with the owner of the company ( a really nice man ) who told me his wife hand packs the jars ! this is truly a family business and one that i feel happy supporting .
 anyone can go to the store and buy instant coffee for a lot less than this , it sucks . you need to stop ripping off the <unknown> would not even give it 1 star but i ca n't send this if i do n't .
 , she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation ; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old . i took her to gi and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked ! and there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time ! i started to puree fruits and veggies using vitamix , and only use gerber fruits & veggies when we are out and about . now , after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food , she 's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food .
 i have a question . are these <unknown> with the <unknown> going to be too big abd bulky for my <unknown> dogs ? i want to order but am worried the <unknown> will be uncomfortable .
 the america 's test kitchen perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe could have come out tasting like <unknown> . well it was the butterscotch chips . i basically took <unknown> 's recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal <unknown> of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats , raisins , chopped mac nuts , cinnamon and these chips . it would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if i would have <unknown> these chips . now as another reviewer said , the cookies with the chips in it are <unknown> for the trash .
 more `` <unknown> '' than just tasting like actual almonds . it 's almost too sharp . the fee <unknown> . <unknown> does contain some orange flavor ( again `` <unknown> '' not actual orange ) . <unknown> 's <unknown> tastes like almonds and it comes through nicely in the cocktails i tried it with ( <unknown> <unknown> and japanese ) . it does n't have the orange or rose water that <unknown> traditionally have but even without that it tastes better than fee brothers ' . the lack of orange water makes it 4 stars instead of 5 .
 while watching tv , i love a good snack to help pass the time . a good low fat fig newton will hit the spot . i 've always loved fig newtons in the past and still do now . with a <unknown> fat vanilla milk , am in business with a remote control in my hands .
 i purchased this thinking the tins would be filled with <unknown> <unknown> treats ! looking back , i see there was no mention of the <unknown> in the item description so that was my fault , but i think these are way overpriced . thankfully for me they only sent one tin instead of six , so i sent it back for a full refund . without the actual treats to put in the tins i do n't really see the point of this set .
 i think it 's like another reviewer said , it really lacks a good black tea body . i love the intense spiciness , but clove dominates . in fact , the clove is so intense , that it <unknown> my mouth half way through a cup . i do n't mind because it reminds me of when i used to smoke <unknown> , but others might .
 pleasure then to note on first use that it not only supplied more body but was helpful in <unknown> those unfortunate <unknown> that develop with age. < br / > < br / > i think this shampoo <unknown> up over time ; i get good results with occasional use , but regular use makes for a sorry , <unknown> effect . interesting though , while humidity ( of which we have little here in <unknown> ) is my hair 's worst enemy , rain on a clear scalp shampoo day did not raise that dreaded halo of <unknown> .
 product is good ; my cats like it . but the price just keeps climbing . i will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food .
 . he seemed to be bored of it after a couple of months . my husband then was going to claim the rest of pouches as his snacks and started to have it with an avocado , my son reached for it . so now , we mashed , somewhat , an avocado in the <unknown> and he would inhale it down in no time ! it 's also a go-to meal when we are having spicy grown-up food and i 'm too lazy to cook him up something else . it also helps him `` go '' regularly .
 this is <unknown> earl grey . i get visitors to my office to smell the bag ! quite possibly the best tea i 've ever had .
 is n't as much as i thought it would be , a co-worker and i finished these in about a week . i thought $ 15 was a great price for the amount but it really is not . i have gone to other stores such as target and bought some of the generic gummy bears which taste almost exactly the same for about half the price . but then if you really do like the haribo gummy bears it is a good purchase , but if you are not picky i would suggest you buy some generic ones .
 i 've bought this item several times before , but now ... < br / > less than 1 year ago , this was $ 6 bucks cheaper , got delivered quickly , and my dogs loved <unknown> < br / > now , these are more expensive than steak , take 10 days to get here , and the new strips look more like bleached cardboard than rawhide , and my dogs suggest i not waste my $ $ on these again. < br / > oh well , that 's progress .
 is much sweeter than sugars used in other <unknown> < br / > < br / > no health problems in babies have been associated with similac organic . but to <unknown> , there are risks in giving babies cane sugar : sucrose can harm tooth <unknown> faster than other sugars ; once babies get used to its sweeter taste , they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods ; and some studies suggest that they might <unknown> , leading to rapid weight gain in the first year , which is often a <unknown> <unknown> of childhood obesity .
 the taste and texture of the thick oats , and they can easily be made into `` quick '' oats for recipies with one or two <unknown> in the food processor - so they are a more versatile oat . they also make chewier oatmeal cookies and a very nice garnish on top of homemade breads or muffins . try vermont pure maple syrup on these hearty oats for a real treat ! < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > butternut mountain farm pure maple syrup , grade a medium amber , 1 pint jug < /a >
 i really love coconut water . i placed thru amazon because <unknown> is not great with <unknown> . i received it in great time . this packaging of vita coco tastes a little different from their larger container which i usually buy but it still tastes great ! this is why i 'm giving it 4 stars because of the slight difference . the expiration was good just a little different taste which i 'm use to now ! but do enjoy !
 do much for me . i was hoping this product would subtly <unknown> my hair and also nourish it and make it softer . this product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair , but did n't make it thicker or softer . this product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in . for my hair , i prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil , so now if i wish to <unknown> my hair i mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results .
 this is fantastic , if you like crystallized ginger that is ... it is not too hard ( like some other ones i have tried ) not too spicy and it 's usda organic . what 's more , a bit of ginger a day is good for you ! i eat at least a couple of pieces a day . it 's also good for <unknown> nausea .
 these chips have a great taste and if you keep it in the front of your mind you can taste the green olives . i do n't know how much olive gets into the chips but just knowing some was in them made them taste fattier to me . ( each serving is 11 % of your recommended daily fat . ) the main ingredients are white and yellow corn .
 my cats love these , so i ordered 2 boxes . one box had been already opened & 1 package of 12 was <unknown> < br / > is someone in the warehouse hungry for cat food ? or maybe they needed to feed the warehouse cats , i do n't know. < br / > no response yet from amazon about replacing the missing package .
 i like strong coffee ; so when this came i made a pot and my husband and i tried it . the coffee is ground fine and is bold in taste but not bitter . other than that i can not say i would buy this coffee . my husband liked it ; i can take it or leave it . melitta has a good name and maybe if this coffee were brewed in a melitta coffee maker and filter ; it might have a different flavor . it was okay .
 love these tea biscuits . the price was great for a box of 12 . i hope you continue to carry .
 love this product and love the fact it was here in two days as well <unknown> and <unknown> product
 this is a great instant soup . it does not have the burned , overcooked taste that you get with campbell 's broccoli soup . it is thick and creamy and one pouch goes a long way .
 the price on these fell to a $ 1 , so i bought 20 of them . i 'm pretty sure they lost money on that deal . i was raised the next day . anyway , the product is great . dogs love them . but i 'm pretty sure they 'd love stale popcorn <unknown> <unknown>
 snack anyway with reasonably good texture that is great for those intolerant of cheese , spice , or stronger flavors . to me these would be much improved with better flavors ... perhaps add a few varieties that taste better and call this one `` corn <unknown> - unflavored '' or `` corn <unknown> - original '' ? i 'd buy other flavors with this texture and quality , but this one is just a bit too bland for <unknown> , does the job it was designed to do : healthy , light , and easy on the body .
 my first impression of <unknown> was that it tasted like coffee grounds . but then i realized that if they were more filling i would in fact enjoy eating coffee grounds . <unknown> is clearly an acquired taste . furthermore , the claims of this product being healthy are somewhat <unknown> by california 's claims that roasted grains cause cancer . <unknown> is a nice change from oatmeal , but it is not as wonderful as the reviews of <unknown> devotees would have you believe .
 < br / > but <unknown> are lovely , crunchy , no grainy texture , no strange after taste , vegan , low calorie and low fat ... actually a miracle of a cookie. < br / > most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat ... and as i limit fat content that was another big draw back. < br / > no problem here though , only <unknown> grams of fat per 4 cookie serving. < br / > i have tried all 4 flavors and each is excellent , i do n't think any would disappoint .
 i like these with a glass of milk . they have improved the packaging for the shipping and arrived in good shape . i had order some previously that were not packed for shipping very well . they arrived quite crumbly , not this last time so i am getting another order .
 between healthy fruit taste and the sensation of carbonated soft drinks with their sparkling juice line . i have n't had a soft drink in over a year since discovering these wonderfully refreshing , healthy alternatives to carbonated soft drinks . since it 's pure fruit juice , it 's also naturally <unknown> ( but not too sweet ) so it also satisfies that `` sweet tooth '' as well . although not a substitute for plain ol ' <unknown> , this beverage definitely satisfies and quenches my thirst . ca n't get enough of these beverages ... ... .
 joint care is very important for your dog , and you should start it early ! once the symptoms appear - it helps , but you can ward off the symptoms longer if you start joint care early in your dog 's life . ask your vet !
 this popcorn is easy to use and turns out just like the stuff you get at the movies but not as expensive . it was delivered right away and my kids love it .
 it 's pretty good . i would recommend it if you like peanuts . a little dry though . it does fill you up when hungry. < br / > < br / > 190 cal < br / > 5g fat < br / > 27g carb < br / > 12g protein
 we go through pamela 's like crazy . fantastic for pancakes ( we like to add a little vanilla to batter ) . it also makes great chocolate chip cookies and banana bread . the 25 lb bag is definately the best way to go value wise .
 excellent product and arrived very quickly . i 'm thrilled to be able to sit back and enjoy a steaming cup of `` memories '' from when i was in the <unknown> and we made sure to stock up for the long winter .
 this sauce has sufficient heat and a good flavor , that is not so strong , that it over powers what food it is put on . the heat may be too much for some , so go sparingly at first ! i really enjoy it .
 when trying to find a descent bonsai that was relatively inexpensive , i happened upon this little kit . when it arrived the plant was in great shape and nothing was broken or missing . the only thing i am doing different is using <unknown> moss instead of soil . if this kit is for a gift or just for you , it is a good choice .
 . i use to love chewing dubble bubble but it contains sugar which , of course , is bad for your teeth . this gum is like the adult version of dubble bubble . it has a refreshing mint flavor that does not hide in the background . the <unknown> flavor is sweet but not over-powering . unlike other sweet or fruity gums this gum actually makes your breath smell good too . it lasts for around 30 minutes and has a good texture the entire time . i have never had a piece fall apart in my mouth .
 exactly what i was looking for ~ the .5 ounce size <unknown> stix = 13 carbohydrates ~ which is about what my daughter , who has type 1 diabetes , needs to treat a low blood sugar . so the description this seller gave is very accurate .
 i am a bacon fiend and was very excited to try baconnaise ! however , after a small taste , both my husband and i found it disgusting . it tastes very chemically and not so much like bacon - more like smoke flavoring . we threw it all away .
 i tried this unknown manufacturer `` stephen 's '' and was pleasantly surprised . it had a good amaretto flavor along with the chocolate . the aroma is good . i use it in my coffee for a homemade mocha taste .
 i love this glaze ! great on any fruit , even ice cream ; delicious finish to chicken or fish . a small amount packs a lot of flavor ! < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > de <unknown> balsamic glaze balsamic reduction 7.6 fl . oz. < /a >
 this is my second shipment . this noodle is delicious even though 1/4 of the noodle in each bag are crushed . oh well , let 's hope the next shipment will be perfect , so i do n't have to spend time shopping and carrying that huge noodle box from an oriental supermarket . by the way , the first shipment was perfect , no crushed noodle .
 it tastes <unknown> , and works <unknown> if yo drink it at the <unknown> time . lean body is the <unknown> with the best flavor i 've ever tasted
 great source of carbs and good for the <unknown> system . being pure buckwheat they will clump together until you rinse them . i think they are much better this way for variety if you have the <unknown> traditional wheat already in your diet elsewhere . i always eat these plain right after cooking and rinsing them and i could not be happier .
 i sure like this product , as i 've always loved the butter popcorn at the movies , but now i usually wait for movies to come to <unknown> . i do n't like popcorn salt alone , and had looked for a solution to my problem . this is the answer , and it 's sure as heck cheaper than the $ 5 per bag at the <unknown> .
 i have a <unknown> in college who loves this drink . i bought her a small frig to keep mostly drinks in and i new she would love a supply of <unknown> <unknown> . i ordered her two cases .
 i purchased these cookies blind , i had not tasted this brand . they were a little crumbly , but not enough to affect the taste . i thought they were wonderful , with only a few broken ones in my delivered box . i would order these again .
 though rather wasteful if you do n't reuse them . fortunately they are very useful . i keep some in a hardware drawer for nails , <unknown> , etc . i keep a dozen in a drawer next to the stove for loose herbs from my garden or spices bought bulk . the containers keep a good seal for freshness , yet are easy to open . i label the tops and keep a `` disposable '' plastic spoon inside each for measuring . if you ca n't use them , give them away ( <unknown> , <unknown> ) .
 me . it is a <unknown> , somewhat dark brown color . kind of like pancake syrup although not as <unknown> < br / > < br / > if your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste , then i guess it is a good buy , but if not it is obviously a <unknown> < br / > < br / > i also can not help but wonder who sat around and thought `` hmmmm , let 's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser ! ! ''
 i found this one rather bland and dry , like most mexican rice . the salsa i added was an improvement . for the same money i could buy a pound of rice and toss in some chili powder or taco seasoning , so i ca n't really recommend it .
 cocoa and a little spice . well , might be a , little too spicy for some . but , i loved them . they 're just so expensive !
 for someone who 's hair is usually light , healthy , and shiny , i did not like the effect this shampoo gave to my hair . for someone who tends to have dry scalp , it might help you . i stopped using it after a week. < br / > after a few uses , the bottle started leaking from the ( almost ) invisible seam holding the lid on . i do n't know if i got a messed up bottle or if this is how they all are . i would not buy this again .
 i have met the <unknown> of the jelly belly and i can report with full confidence , that this is one tasty licorice jelly bean . a jelly belly is smaller than jelly beans and that is why <unknown> <unknown> liked them so much . my personal favorite flavor is licorice . 5 stars !
 emeril 's big easy bold is very bold and tasty and a great way to start the day ! not an expert on new <unknown> 's style coffee , but i love it 's flavor !
 these seed taste really good . i wish they were a little <unknown> if they were i would have given them a 5 rather than 4 . enjoy !
 , i use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet . i pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet , and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a <unknown> up paper towel . the salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the ridged bottom of my cast iron grill pan . works perfectly . i usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because i use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron .
 i purchased these to take to work so i 'd have a snack in the afternoons . good for you , although a little less salt would be nice , and very reasonably priced compared to buying out of the vending machine. < br / > < br / > in the future though , i think i 'll just buy cashews in the bulk and package them myself in <unknown> size bags .
 this is wonderful stuff -- not vinegary at all . i could almost drink it . i gave bottles out to my family for christmas . they will never use anything else !
 so good and only one <unknown> watcher <unknown> care of my craving for sweets and fruit . takes awhile to chew these babies satisfying your hunger .
 away . she wants what she wants ! ! so trying this product i went in with a wary attitude . alas , she went right for it ! so far i have tried three of the flavors and she has liked each one . being so old i have had trouble finding brands that worked well with her digestive system . i have had no problems with petite cuisine so far . looks like this is a winner in my house . if you have a fussy eater try this one out . you may be pleasantly surprised !
 the best way to enjoy this is as hot chocolate . mix 2 wedges of chocolate with 6-8 ounces of milk and heat until dissolved . pour mixture into a blender and beat for 30 seconds on high . delicious !
 ordered the peanut butter with dark chocolate first and these were exceptionally good . then went back and ordered the coconut and almond which was outstanding too ! put both on <unknown> so i 'm not left without . ca n't believe the awesome price i got too ! !
 wow , these cookies are amazing , i ate the whole bag right after i opened them and my friends ate the rest faster than i could blink . they are bite size , crispy , and delicious . you must try these ! ! !
 does not seem to be as strong as regular brew . that is true , probably due to the type of grind . my <unknown> to the issue is to have a regular coffee cup in place , but choose the smallest cup on the keurig , which gives you roughly half a cup of coffee . lift the handle as though you are going to remove the kcup and just push it back down and brew a second tiny cup into the already brewed cup . <unknown> ! perfect . i definitely recommend and will certainly purchase again .
 if i could give these bars a 10 , i would . they are by far the best tasting gluten free bar i have had . this brand , kind bars , use fresh ingredients with little processing . all varieties that i 've had have been phenomenal . i ca n't say enough good things about them !
 powder for some desserts . have to admit , the dessert with banana and the powder did n't come out great but it 's because i am not crazy about bananas . instead , the one we made with figs and almonds , yum ! we have been using the raw cacao powder with that recipe just by putting it in a simple food processor . the powder is delicious . it is chocolatey but not overwhelming and not too sweet or too bitter , it is really perfect . and i love that it 's raw ! yum !
 to bloom soon , i am so looking forward to the sight and the smell. < br / > my only problem with this item is that i received it without the plate that i shown on the pic . amazon resent me the whole thing again ( they ca n't send only part of the item ) but still the plate did n't come with it. < br / > i do n't understand why i did n't get the item the way it was shown on the website ... .that 's a pity i am quite disappointed .
 its cat food that was offered at a good price ... and being a premier member , i got free speedy shipping . cat food starts out hard when it enters the cat . it <unknown> the kitty as a soft item a day later , minus <unknown> ( hopefully ) .
 ordered two packages . each was supposed to have four bags . one package was opened and one bag was missing . whoever boxed the two packages must have been hungry and helped themselves to one . in addition , they were overpriced . i see them at the checkout counter at walmart for $ 3 a bag . do the math .
 this is my first time and i ca n't eat them they are all small hard <unknown> with only a <unknown> <unknown> ones . is there something wrong with my batch ? i ca n't eat them or they would break my teeth am i doing something wrong i only cook them 1 min .
 this is an excellent product at a really good price . it is called lasagna but it works as an egg noodle . i bought more past <unknown> products after i tried this and yes i 'm italian so pasta is important .
 milk , she ate more <unknown> and got constipated with <unknown> . we had bought this to help with digestion , as formula is based on cow 's milk . this goat 's milk seemed to have the opposite effect on our baby , and she did n't gain weight . also , the taste is n't so great. < br / > < br / > we can use it as back up , in case we do n't have milk in the fridge . so , it 's ok , but i probably wo n't buy again .
 this was delicious ! the taste is sweet , like banana bread , and the chewy , soft texture with nuts on top is good ! i would n't buy this , though , just due to calories/sugar content .
 of sugar <unknown> , my mom hardly ever bought them because they were so sweet with too much sugar . if you like the sweet taste of sugar <unknown> , only in the shape of a <unknown> and super crunchy , you 'll love this new kellogg 's crunchy nut roasted nut and honey cereal . i 've noticed the kids putting this crunchy cereal in their vanilla yogurt with fruit and they just love it ! they were enjoying it so much , i tried it too . all i can say in between every crunch is yummy !
 love this cornbread mix , very moist when the others are dry and crumbly . well worth it .
 most <unknown> do n't last long with my dog , this product lasted about 2 weeks , which is pretty good for something that 's not plastic . my dog also loved this bone , he would chew it non stop for hours , and i plan on getting him another . one thing to watch out for is <unknown> , most were large and so i did n't have to worry .
 met all my expectations about this wonderful sweetener . the price is n't bad either . i would recommend this to anyone who is tired of all the bad tasting sweeteners out there .
 the sodium and sugar ( often corn syrup ) in tomato sauces is <unknown> . plus , <unknown> you eat white pasta to boot but <unknown> you eat rice and beans . trust me - do n't buy your sauces around your meals , get salsa and plan meals around it. < br / > < br / > they arrived in a day or two and the bottles were shiny and fresh , i was afraid of warehouse dust and old stock . the vendor did really well .
 once again van houtte scores as my favorite coffee brand . i usually like flavored coffees but decided to get this for friends and family that want `` real '' coffee . this has a full bodied flavor that is very good .
 pay for 10 pound bag of the <unknown> long grain rice ) < br / > < br / > so i am not sure what happened here , i feel like i just paid a premium price for rice i did n't even want . so beware you wo n't get the rice which is pictured above and you will pay premium price for it too , such a disappointment . and to top it all , i do n't even have an option to return it according to amazon 's return policy even though it 's sealed !
 i love this product . packed with protein , low fat and great for us <unknown> , this product rocks . the best thing ? it can be used for camping , travel , emergencies ( such as <unknown> , <unknown> , etc . ) , and <unknown> ... i highly recommend this delicious product !
 from amazon whenever the price is right , and they have what i want . the packages of wafers came as expected , however when i got them , one package had it 's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh . the other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had <unknown> off of each other , causing a `` <unknown> ' wafer . not the upright wafer cookie i expected . all in all , i will take a second look before i buy eatable items from amazon .
 a friend of mine told me about the ginger honey crystals . she gave me one to try and i was hooked . i use them when my stomach is upset . i have use them with cold and hot water . i prefer it in my hot green tea or just with hot water . it is very soothing . i have given a bag to my sister and she loves it .
 i was expecting the hot chocolate that you make with milk . this is a regular mix that you add water too . the flavor is no where near as good as the one i got before . the package looks the same and you ca n't read the fine print online to see that it 's a different cocoa . my kids enjoy this , but i like the other one .
 quick <unknown> if your on the go when your in a hurry to be some where , just open , slap and eat ... bam ! !
 this candy is the best . kids love it . so buy some and eat it all . when i was looking for chocolate last halloween . i looked for candy . all over the place . at <unknown> and target and all of the halloween stores . but it was all trash if you know what i mean . and guess what enjoy all 150 chocolates .
 i really like them , i add them to my smoothies for lunch and it makes them more filling and i like the flavor !
 like i do then i highly recommend this. < br / > < br / > the taste is excellent and i use this in a variety of dishes . i always get complements on my dishes i use this in too. < br / > < br / > if you have just found out that either you or your child has a soy allergy i recommend looking at this list to help you avoid other forms of soy you do n't even realize were soy like msg. < br / > < br / > [ ... ]
 the bars i received through amazon were also very crumbly , a different color , dry , and brittle . in comparison , the store bought ones were moist , darker ( the color of dates ) , and did n't crumble or fall apart as i tried to eat them . plus , i 'm not saving any money by purchasing the bars through amazon . from now on , i 'm just gon na purchase my lara bars at trader joe 's . it 's the same price and i know i 'll have a fresher product .
 very picky husband and very picky 4 and 6 year olds . i live in a small town and after many requests the local store started to carry this for me and the local gf group and they cant keep it on the shelves . i have yet to try the other pastas by this company but i trust they will be good to . the sticky issue i never have <unknown> i usually add plenty of water and a little oil . love this pasta and always have <unknown> 2 or three packs <unknown> away in the pantry !
 i bought this at a store in the area to see if my daughter would like it , not only does she like it , she loves it . she has already drank alot of the bottle . i 'm so happy that she likes since its veggies and juice in one cup . the reason for leaving this review is because i am on amazon looking for juice in bulk to see if its cheaper .
 n't think you need to sample it. < br / > in the end , though , i can enjoy all the flavors , and will almost certainly purchase this sampler again. < br / > < br / > note on teas : it looks like the new set does not include the ginger peach or the pomegranate raspberry , which is disappointing . also no fusion breakfast . there is now a jasmine blossom and a lemon spice , which sound great . i am not excited for the <unknown> sushi ' tea but we 'll see .
 this is excellent product , great for coffee lovers . the k-cups are very consistent and considering the price , much better than a trip to the coffee shop .
 i have tried several dried apple brands available in bulk online and at warehouse stores and so far these are the best . i prefer slightly soft dried apples . other brands have been too crunchy or filled with <unknown> preservatives .
 i am on a severely limited carb diet plus have wheat and gluten allergies but love pasta and really miss it . these are a dream come true for me . now i can have pasta dishes and not go off my diet or trigger allergies . i made <unknown> thai with them and it was as good as using a traditional noodle . i will be making repeat orders for sure .
 or <unknown> or even black squid ink pasta . just do not be too <unknown> in draining . some pasta water is nice . add a spoon or two if that is easier . garnish with fresh oregano , marjoram or <unknown> < br / > < br / > prefer rice ? use feta and kalamata olives or feta and small shrimp with blanched <unknown> < br / > < br / > get to know this seed . you might see them labeled as <unknown> . <unknown> is a first rate source of highest quality and freshness .
 the sugar salt combo season is so bad that i soaked them in water , washed out the canister and air dried them . then and only then were they tasty .
 this coffee is horrible ! there is almost no caramel taste , it just tastes like burnt coffee . i usually love starbucks and was really disappointed with this purchase .
 i love my keurig coffee maker . i like the different coffee flavors and the easy way of just making one cup at a time . sometimes you have friends over and everyone likes something different . with the keurig , they make whatever type coffee they want . amazon delivered my k-cups fast and easy . i was able to pay with pay <unknown> and i feel assured my transaction will take place safely .
 yum ! i could live off of this stuff . the peach flavor is refreshing and delicious . it 's no longer sold where i live , and i really miss it . ( ca n't even get it from amazon . ) it 's just too good to be discontinued .
 upon <unknown> order , boston baked beans were immediately thrown in the trash . it may be a personal <unknown> but , they were hard as a rock and not soft at all where the coating is <unknown> were removed from my list . i ordered a good supply but , was really disapointed . not so much in the seller but , in the product .
 junk in it that i liked . now it is just another overpriced mainstream sugar cereal . obviously general mills is trying to <unknown> profits by <unknown> the ingredients in their line of foods . poor form in my opinion . i agree with the other reviews . at the very least , inform people . they have lost me as a purely o 's customer , and i question whether or not i can trust the brand in general . do n't bother with this cereal . it 's no longer worth the premium you need to pay .
 these kind bars have got to be one of the best ! whenever i am having a chocolate craving , a chocolate cherry & cashew bar will definitely fix it . they arrived in perfect condition ! !
 . by now , i am very concerning what food should be included in our diets to maintain good health . especially , high calories food based on carb make me worried about my diet . but ! since i tried this product , which is real good , i stop worrying to eat rice . it 's real low calories , healthy organic brown rice , not expensive , and easy to cook ( just only <unknown> . <unknown> . in the <unknown> ) . anyway , i really enjoy this product , and of course buy again .
 i tried this spaghetti with the hopes that it would in some way resemble the wheat pasta i used to love to eat , but it does n't even come close . the taste is <unknown> and bland , and it falls apart despite following the cooking directions . there are many good <unknown> pasta products out there these days , but this is n't one of them .
 chips make a great side dish on a bbq plate with baked beans , coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat . naturally , they also go down great with beer. < br / > < br / > the sea salt & vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes . skip the dip ; balance the tangy chips by <unknown> bites of raw vegetable. < br / > < br / > in summary , i highly recommend kettle brand chips , a great buy on amazon.com .
 description says 6 bags per <unknown> tray . in fact , it is one bag per <unknown> tray . different product delivered than advertised . not misleading , but <unknown> deceitful .
 9 pills a day ) to get the desired effect . also , you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses . after a couple days of starting supplementation , i saw an increase in my supply , so i am now able to pump enough milk for my baby 's bottles during the day while i am at work . thanks to the fenugreek , i 'm getting a 2-3 ounce boost per day , which is not a huge amount , but it 's all i needed . good luck !
 my coffee . it sweetens & flavors it just right ! the only thing that bothered me once i received my order was that the label says chocolate , not dark chocolate . when i called the company , they told me it is the same dark chocolate that it 's always been , that they just changed the label . honestly , that does n't make a whole lot of sense to me . if it 's dark chocolate , label it such . even so , the flavor is great , as far as i 'm concerned .
 i put 1-2 teabags of easy now in an entire teapot let it steep for 20-30 min and have some before bed . no matter when i got to sleep , i always wake up 7-8 hours later , feeling good , and without having <unknown> up in the middle of the night . ( except maybe to use the <unknown> , but i always fall back asleep instantly ) its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves , it wo n't make you sleepy . this is easily my favorite calming tea .
 i have been feeding this salmon recipe to my king charles since i was concerned of his health . he has been eating this for more than 3 months now and he is doing great . not only his fur , but his strength increased a lot as well .
 darjeeling is the most delightful tea served either piping hot or ice cold . buying in bulk from amazon saved me 60 % over grocery store price. < br / > i will never purchase tea any other way .
 i 'm always trying new <unknown> of coffee . i found this one about <unknown> ago . it now is one of my favorite flavored coffees . i 've served this to several of my friends and most all of them have liked it . in fact 4 of them now buy it on a regular basis . so , if you like flavored coffee , you might want to give this one a try . enjoy . # # #
 this tea has the right aroma & taste of chai tea . the tea itself is a little too weak for my <unknown> but add a bag of tetley while brewing it & you are good to go . refreshingly good ! !
 i have always liked sunflower seeds , until i have had the dill flavored ones , now im in love with them ! these are truly amazing ... i honestly have a bag every two days ! i can not stop eating them ! <unknown> : highly <unknown>
 it is extremely sour . kids love it but i have to say it has to be really bad for your <unknown> acidic .
 for me the tea has light taste , i drink it once a day for about 2 months , hoping to have better hair and nails ( after seeing it on <unknown> ) . so far , i have n't seen the result , yet , but i 'm hopeful .
 . no bitter aftertaste < br / > 2 . nice round dark flavor < br / > < br / > con : < br / > 1 . only personal <unknown> little too dark for me. < br / > < br / > do n't get me wrong , this is a good coffee , but as i measure and compare all coffee with the <unknown> java coffee , this coffee just falls <unknown> < br / > but for those of you who prefer dark roasts , this would be a good coffee to get .
 that 's some excellent peanut butter . smooth and creamy texture , spreads easily , good roasted peanut flavor . not too sweet or too dry . just right !
 these are not sold in stores where i live , so i had to order them online . they are the best pretzels ever , we eat them all the time .
 these cashews are fresh , large and delicious . i was pleased that they arrived so soon after i placed my order . since my family and i love cashews , i 'll be buying more .
 snack so the first time around i did n't mind the expense . however , now that i know what to expect , i will not purchase again unless the packaging and fruit <unknown> ' issues could be addressed . then it might be worth the money . until then , i 'll buy my own fresh bananas , mangoes and <unknown> < br / > < br / > i will admit , however , a few of these put together in a gift basket would make a nice presentation for someone who has never tried this product .
 this is actually an orange flavored jelly stick covered in dark chocolate that is made with real orange juice . it does , however , taste like chocolate covered oranges but without the texture associated with eating oranges . four pieces are 140 calories with 30 fat calories and 21 grams of sugar . for those with peanut allergies , these are processed in a peanut free plant as per the description on the back of the bag. < br / > < br / > this is definitely candy and definitely tasty to both me and my boyfriend .
 you cant use an air popper for these because they are to small and just fly out i dont know how they taste i gave them away to a friend who had a kettle popper
 as the instructions say but it did n't have as much flavor as i like. < br / > my whole family loved it. < br / > the only thing is i used rice stick noodles that were n't very good . i 've tried thin rice noodles but those were about the same as the sticks . my local restaurant uses rice noodles that are very soft and look close to an angel hair pasta size . maybe i 'm not cooking the rice noodles long enough because they did n't get as soft as i like .
 in the car with em - but only when i 'm not alone and another <unknown> can clean up possible <unknown> damage . ' < br / > < br / > i bought this during a special and signed up for subscribe & save and the price was far better than in stores ( amazon was <unknown> % of my stores price ) . i 'm definitely going to keep purchasing this product and try out other pure blended fruit flavors - i 'm a little wary of the <unknown> of milk ' products that require no refrigeration .
 i was expecting the beef stick to be like one of the pictured <unknown> with a natural looking sausage type snack that is a little thick . instead , these individually wrapped sticks are very long but small diameter . as such , much of the texture is the casing and not the meat . i also wish the original flavor was a little more peppery .
 in comparing this jet fuel with other brands i can certainly taste a great difference . this is dark , rich with a nice aroma . i really like it ! it is strong , but not bitter . dark and <unknown> . try it and you 'll probably agree with me .
 i was quite pleased with e flavor of this product . a good , strong , yet not overpowering flavor . rich chocolate flavor . very pleasing . i highly recomend this product !
 add way more sugar than necessary . the first few bags it did n't bother me so much , but now i can hardly eat them without feeling sick followed by a big sugar crash . pineapple by itself is sweet , and then when it 's dried it 's a concentrated sweetness , why on top of that did they feel the need to add more sugar ? they are coated with it sort of like those round sunkist fruit candies ! i surely wish i could find another brand that is inexpensive and does n't add sugar ...
 great flavor and love the snap ! when your looking for something crunchy that is n't high in calories ( a <unknown> high in carbs though ) these are amazing and you can have 17 crackers in a serving . i was buying them at an natural health food store for $ <unknown> a package . a much better deal for a case here on amazon ( about 1.00 less per package )
 not the best thing i 've ever tasted , but pretty good . the first couple bites are confusing and strange but it gets better . they get really good after the first ten . i got my box of chips yesterday and i 've already eaten two bags . they are yummy . much better for you than regular chips . i do n't feel guilty at all for eating so many . the bags are a little small though . i 'm still debating on whether or not twelve small bags of chips are worth $ 25 .
 , some say it has no flavor or there are n't chunks in it . the flavor is mild , but that is good- not overwhelmingly <unknown> and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup . if i want to , next time i will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it 's <unknown> not a big deal to do . i would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that does n't care about healthy ingredients and <unknown> of ingredients . i will buy this <unknown> good source of iron as well .
 great , fresh coffee beans . gave as a christmas gift . we all had some of it and loved it . the smell was great and the flavour was awsome .
 to see what they could do with tropical flavors . like coconut . ( their lemon one is on my must try list . ) < br / > definitely a product i can recommend , for those who like chocolate. < br / > < br / > -- mine came with an expiration date 11 months away and seemed fresh . i did n't experience any <unknown> on them or have any stale bars . i do n't know if <unknown> has solved the issue or it 's a luck of the draw type thing , though. --
 love the taste of zevia . it tastes clean and crisp , and makes <unknown> sodas taste especially gross to me now . i am a former addict of diet mt . dew and was so happy to find a healthier product to replace it . was the first glass of mt . zevia exactly what i expected ? no . but by the second glass , i was hooked . i have n't looked back ! i 've liked every flavor i 've tried , and am on the hunt for the new strawberry flavor to buy locally .
 i have been a beef jerky fan for many years and have tried so many different brands . in the past year i have started making my own due to the prices of beef jerky at most supermarkets . this is one of the best beef jerky 's i have had . the consistency is great as is the flavor . not as sweet as i thought it would be , but still excellent . sweet but still has some spice notes . i will definitely buy it again !
 not . when you get the package and you read the smaller print it says <unknown> powder . aka , it 's small crystals . when i think powdered i thought of the consistency of actual powdered sugar , light and fluffy ... not crystals . i had a hard time getting it to dissolve and while it tastes good and just like sugar i just was disappointed with the `` powder '' label . so if you 're looking for a sugar substitute , get this . tastes good . looking for powder , do n't get this .
 web site and completely missed the 0 calorie description . i was expecting a tasty gluten free ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as ranch ( or dressing for that matter ) . i ca n't believe that two reviews imply that this stuff has flavor . well , that 's true , but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish <unknown> dipped it in <unknown> paint and <unknown> it out on your salad : this is vile and nasty stuff ! do n't waste your money on this one .
 if you like fresh coconut milk i would highly recommend you do not purchase this product . it is nasty - there is an odd taste to the product .
 in conjunction with fish . be prepared to either eat the <unknown> <unknown> and various entrails , or to remove ( clean ) them yourself. < br / > < br / > how do they taste ? < br / > < br / > not bad , if you 're into <unknown> herring . these babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky , salty taste. < br / > < br / > but do n't worry . it 's not just any smoke , but `` <unknown> natural smoke '' that they 're treated with ...
 just <unknown> my previous experience with <unknown> gourmet -- the product was <unknown> value for the price <unknown> with shipping <unknown> -- and when i had to return something ( my fault ) -they were great about it and refunded my $ promptly ... i will continue to order from them as they have a great selection -- and they do samples -- which was wonderful to be able to try ! ! !
 this is the better coffee i have found in a k cup . deep , rich , smooth flavor . no bitterness . worth the few extra cents per cup .
 little more and fell asleep but then when she woke she <unknown> for hours as though she were in pain , curled up , turned red , wouldnt sleep for longer than ten minutes and it took me half a day to realize the only thing i had done different was take four of the capsules . i actually liked the maple syrup smell but she looked like she was in so much pain i just can not give this a full five stars . there should be something on the label that warns or more reviews about it .
 go to the break room to boil water . i can simply enjoy the tea right in my own <unknown> - just add bottled water and the tea bag , a little sugar for taste and there you go ! < br / > < br / > though i like the flavor , i would prefer a bit more of a mint taste . however , the taste of the tea is very light which makes it a very refreshing tea . i find myself drinking 2 or 3 of these pretty much every afternoon at the office .
 love <unknown> <unknown> flavor ! i could n't find it in the local grocery store and glad that amazon has it . taste might be too strong for some people but this is just right for me .
 i purchased this 12 pack of pumpkin and was delighted . all cans were perfect ... no dents at all . the pumpkin was flavorful and great to work with . i would recommend this purchase highly .
 i used this to make homemade pastrami . very hard to find locally and online . if you are dry curing meats this is necessary . made excellent pastrami many times next i will have to try bacon `` the maple kind '' .
 i carry jolt gum in my purse and find that i am most likely to use it if i am feeling really sleepy while driving . it is much more convenient than stopping for a caffeinated beverage and puts off the need for finding a bathroom that a <unknown> would make necessary . i like coffee , but tire of it sometimes . this <unknown> gum tastes great !
 , it is difficult to find a bone they can all enjoy . from the biggest to the smallest , these bones were a hit . keep in mind , the bigger dogs `` wolfed '' them down , but the little dogs took their time . these were more substantial than expected . they have an `` easy digest '' center wrapped in a <unknown> shell . though a great quality product , i would not recommend this particular size for anything larger than a cocker spaniel . these served as a good time killer for the babies .
 makes my gluten free breads and desserts the absolute best ! my bread seems to be nice and tender -- not gummy and gluey . thanks essential depot for a great product .
 '' benefits of fresh breath , plaque and overall quality of stuff . i like to treat my kids now and again and they love them so much they have even taken to <unknown> these treats as `` greenies '' ! yes i know it is typically the tone but they even get excited if you say the word green now , its crazy . so i 'd say , get these for your kids they will love them so much you 'll have a hard time <unknown> them at least one a day . i know i do .
 my pit loves to chew so i purchased this because it looked durable . it is very tough toy and i think it will last awhile compared to others i have purchased . the only thing i didnt like is that it has little `` nubs '' all over it which make his gums <unknown> , but that might not be the case with a less agressive chewer .
 i have been purchasing items from the `` bean project '' since <unknown> . every product has been delicious , fresh and easy to prepare . the `` bean project '' is an excellent helping hand for women who are turning their lives around and working to <unknown> ! if you try nothing else , try their chili mixes and their very tasty black bean soup !
 i 'm not sure what makes these `` new zealand '' style , but my dog loved them . each 10oz pack has 6 good sized treats . they 're seemingly hard as rock but my dog , a fairly large 6 month old mutt , loved them . he just crunched away for about 10 minutes on each one . he definitely preferred them to milkbone and his breath was better . i do n't know that they would be suitable for a puppy without all his adult teeth , but mine was fine .
 i use it everyday in my <unknown> shakes . it tastes great . and only 45 calories for a serving ? ca n't beat that . save yourself hundreds of calories a day by <unknown> this for normal peanut butter in your protein shakes .
 this mustard is great , just right on <unknown> and taste . the shipping was fast and there was no damage not even to the box . i 'll be ordering more in the future. < br / > < br / > thanks
 i have a cafe in <unknown> , oregon . i couldnt find this product wholesale anywhere . this is so convienient and free shipping and it was here in just a few days ! ! my supplier could only get small amounts of inferior product and it would take 3 weeks . thanks amazon !
 i am allergic to many `` cholesterol free '' oil substitutes and preservatives , i simply can not process these kinds of fats . la <unknown> coconut oil is unrefined virgin & organic , it contains zero trans fats and is easily absorbed by the human body . i use it as a substitute for virtually every oil a recipe calls for , save olive oil . <unknown> and <unknown> when cold and turns to liquid at room temp , but never <unknown> ! awesome stuff !
 cooked according to package instructions , water turned like thin glue and the `` pasta '' noodles fell all to pieces before getting tender . worst gluten-free pasta ever !
 back to parachute and i will not buy anything else but parachute from now on . to scared to try anything else out of fear i might get a product like that organic stuff i brought . if you truly have a love for coconut and know how to appreciate the true `` taste '' and `` smell '' of coconut then you will appreciate and `` love '' parachute . parachute is better than nutiva hands down ! ! < br / > < br / > now i am going to use it for coconut popcorn also .
 and was discontinued ... ... i was lost till now ! it is pretty close to the same taste and very good ! if you are looking for see 's candies or something of that type ... you seriously think you are going to find it produced this way ? ? i would recomend this product to anyone who enjoys chocolate and peanut butter . but please if you are looking for gourmet candy bar ... .. save your change and pull out the paper money and head to see 's candies or some other <unknown> it is great !
 not a very tasty halvah , possibly because of the poor choice of ingredients. < br / > < br / > just what we need - hydrogenated oils and foaming <unknown> < br / > < br / > seriously , what happened to real food with real ingredients ?
 these are amazing . they are so amazing you should buy cases and cases of them and <unknown> them in case they are taken off the market .
 add cooked beef or chicken as well . it 's easy to make up a batch for the day or to <unknown> in advance in case you 'll be away or super-busy for awhile . my black lab <unknown> has been thriving on this food for over three years . she has no skin <unknown> , appears to be <unknown> and has never had any kind of digestive problem . and her coat is really lovely ... soft and glossy . this way of feeding is so much better than kibble . hope you give it a try ... ..
 `` the 8-oz size makes the ideal cup of coffee , but you can vary the cup size if you want to change the coffee 's strength ( for example , choose a larger cup size to get a less intense cup of coffee ) . `` < br / > < br / > if you are concerned about freshness , our box of <unknown> cups came with an expiration date of july 10 , 2011 , or more than six months from our purchase date. < br / > < br / > rating : five stars .
 when i first tried this i was skeptical , i mean powdered anything does n't sound too appealing . but i have to say i was pleasantly <unknown> by how much i really like this peanut butter . it does n't have any `` weird stuff '' in it and it actually tastes like peanuts . i cant say it tastes exactly like jarred peanut butter but it is very good . at a difference of 45 calories vs 190 calories for same serving size ... it 's well worth it !
 tried <unknown> once and have been hooked ever since . also anyone who tries it also asks me to buy them some . nice tasting candy , i recommend this product to all .
 well to control dandruff and it also leaves my hair feeling very clean . i am a long time head & shoulders user and generally default back to it when shopping , but will consider this specific type from clear if it is <unknown> <unknown> < br / > < br / > my hair is normally very oily so i like that this is a little `` stronger '' than most other dandruff shampoos , without having an overpowering scent. < br / > < br / > recommended ! < br / > < br / > cfh
 the only coffee that actually gets me going in the morning . i love the rich aroma and deep coffee taste . the is no funky aftertaste , just a good kick of caffeine energy . this coffee rocks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
 great product , just a <unknown> sweet . no ingredients label so not able to see if sugar was added , but otherwise very pleased with the product . smooth purchase transaction
 i tried out different oatmeal as i have started eating healthy for the first time ever . this oatmeal tastes great straight out of the box whereas other organic oatmeal i get in stores tastes `` dusty '' and <unknown> milk or water . get it , wo n't regret it .
 we purchased these pumps to go with the <unknown> bottles of torani syrup we ordered . they work as advertised . they fit perfectly in the bottles and provide the exact amount of syrup we need . of course some testing will be required to obtain the amount required for your own taste .
 it 's a different kind of green tea that one might have to an acquire a taste for . i loved it the moment i tired it . there 's a <unknown> to yamamotoyama unlike any other ice tea that i 've tired . when drinking it , you wo n't feel sluggish and tired like some of the other sugary <unknown> out on the market .
 < br / > as soon as they came , i opened 1 can and ate it . the first thought i had about it was , `` where 's the flavor ? '' and then as i ate more and more of it , buyer 's <unknown> <unknown> in as i knew i could n't return these and i was stuck with 23 more cans of it. < br / > < br / > so , i was pretty disappointed with the flavor , or lack thereof and will probably stick to getting the king oscar kind .
 this is a great tasting alternative for those who are allergic to peanut butter or those who just want to try something new . we have allergies in our family , so we do n't keep pb in the house . my entire family loves the flavor and texture . i would highly recommend trying it . we got a free sample from the manufacturer 's website first , and then purchased the case on amazon .
 i love flavored coffee ! having 6 flavors is awesome . i am not crazy about the vanilla but that is because i like chocolate more . these flavors are also good in yogurt . i always have trouble choosing a flavor coffee in the a.m. so i have a second cup just to have more flavors . love these !
 we found this dog food online and could n't believe that it was 95 % beef with no fillers ! this is hard to beat for pet food . our guys love this food and it is nice to know it is n't filled with junk . highly recommend this food .
 this is amongst the best <unknown> <unknown> i have eaten . not rubbery or super chewy like a lot of the other ones ... just <unknown> individually wrapped pieces in the box .
 140 calories . it is absolutely delicious . it 's super soft but also has crunchy bits like a health bar . the banana nut flavor is prominent . it suggests warming it up on the package and i 'm sure that is delicious , but after the first little bite , i kept on eating till my bar was gone , so i did n't get a chance to try it warmed up . i 'll keep my eye out for it in the stores to get me a couple boxes and let the whole family try it .
 i routinely keep a <unknown> of up to fifty ( yes that 's 50 ) hot sauces in my <unknown> . it is safe to say that i have a hot sauce `` problem '' . this is the sauce that gets used the fastest and <unknown> the most often . it is not a `` typical '' sauce by any means - it has a fruity flavor , but it can bring a little pain at times too . i would recommend this sauce to anyone who wants something out of the ordinary and exceptional .
 this is the best thing i have ever purchased .. works amazing and you do n't have to make a whole cup of coffee and waste it .
 my husband likes it , he is getting it for a gift , already drinks it , but sometimes hard to find . if you like coffee , it is probably good
 body , i.e . a <unknown> holding the coffee , instead of the k-cup 's <unknown> body . typical pods come in individual sealed packets to preserve freshness , but all 12 <unknown> in each <unknown> box are in a single , <unknown> plastic envelope . this means that once you 've opened the envelope , you 're losing freshness faster than usual . again i 'm no purist , but this would lead to <unknown> coffee if you 're not brewing these in a hurry - or <unknown> them somehow ? the box offers no advice or directions .
 a floral <unknown> to the cereal that does n't belong . i do n't get this with `` honey bunches of oats '' or the like , but have experienced in a cereal called `` puffins '' . < br / > < br / > i have four kids ( 5 through 13 ) and , although they ate <unknown> of the cereal , no one was eager for more and a few did n't finish . i certainly would n't buy this again . there are tastier and healthier ( at the same time ! ) alternatives .
 less energy dense . the 12 packs of puffed millet are a good deal and are much less energy dense . i like to mix a bowl with a little himalayan pink salt , stevia , cinnamon and crushed walnuts , 1/2 to 1 walnut per bowl . the walnuts probably help with the glycemic load . i 'd like to see amazon carry amaranth puffs , or puffed quinoa . puffed quinoa would be ideal . i 'd stock up on it if the price beat what is out there , namely <unknown> standard <unknown> order truck delivery .
 <unknown> ) off low-quality <unknown> foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble , which they eat well . they would n't eat it at first , and then only grudgingly . i am going to try again , but i am distressed because i do n't like throwing out food . i will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this . but i am warning anyone who is trying this that it is n't immediately appealing to my five totally different ( and hungry ) dogs .
 i am addicted to potato chips . i love these ruffles in the individual bags , because i can limit myself to 1 oz . a day . that 's a good thing , right ?
 i love- <unknown> my coffee with chicory which adds a <unknown> and lowers the caffeine without hurting the taste . however not all chicory root available is roasted and granulated . this chicory is and can simply be added to a drip coffee maker along with the coffee . i match it with a rich dark roast , and use a quarter to a third of chicory .
 i 've had dark magic , starbucks pike 's place , and starbucks sumatra . out of the three , i prefer the dark magic , especially given the price .
 hooked ! ! ! the combination flavor of dark chocolate & pomegranates is simply delightful & there is no way you can eat just one . . . before you know it , the bag vanishes ! ! so , now i order at least 4 bags at a time - they are perfect for gifts & i have used them for dessert , instead of cake , and they just satisfy the craving for something sweet perfectly ! if you are craving chocolate , this is the perfect solution - your taste buds will thank you ~ ! ~
 i 'm not a huge flavored coffee fan . usually i prefer lattes with flavored syrups . a friend sent me a k-cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing . the flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk ; i added a little vanilla syrup when i reheated it . i am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there . it is just a unique taste for when you 're in the mood for something different !
 works great , caught hundreds of gnats ! just wished it came with more sticky cards but for the price not too bad .
 im not a big fan of extra strong dark chocolate , but the health benefits are many so i figured i would try a few of them out . this is by far the best one . actually has more of a sweet taste and any bitterness is hard to even notice . packed with antioxidants . a few squares a day is a great addition to any healthy diet .
 like a regular cracker . really tasty ! my <unknown> mother really enjoyed them , and my <unknown> father said : `` really awesome '' . there is just the right balance between <unknown> and honey ; the sweetness is there , but not at all overpowering . not as heavily `` <unknown> '' as a fig newton , but one can fully taste the fig flavor . the <unknown> cracker does n't give it an overly <unknown> taste ; the fruit flavor definitely comes through ! i 'm going out to locate the other three flavors , too !
 i sent these to my dad for his <unknown> and he said they were really pretty good . he 's hard to buy for so that says a lot : )
 , <unknown> to be `` belgian pearl sugar '' ( it 's written on the box ! ) , we can only be disappointed . i guess it 's good enough for those who never been in belgium or those who just passed by there ... those swedish made pearl sugar - at least they are not the rocky sugar - are too big , melt during cooking , give a taste of caramel instead , making the waffle chewy . oh well ... i 'm sure one day we 'll find the real belgian pearl sugar somewhere online ...
 < br / > con : unfortunately , my picky eaters did not like them because they were too moist . they are messy to eat , and do not contain as much fiber per serving as some other brands. < br / > < br / > pro : i still like them , and will have to finish the carton myself - over a period of weeks , of course . the pouches keep them fresher than those cardboard containers some other brands use . still a good price vs. supermarket , and merchant delivered very fast .
 my two shih tzu are picky eaters . but they seem to like the wellness foods better than any other i 've tried . however , this particular variety does n't seem to be quite as big of a hit with them as the other wellness canned varieties we 've tried . but they do eat it . as for it helping with food <unknown> and for sensitive <unknown> i 'm not so sure yet . i 've been feeding it to them for several weeks now , but do n't see any <unknown> so far .
 i miss eating the way i used to before i found out i am allergic to wheat . this is a great substitute for cream of mushroom soup . you can not tell the difference . it tastes great !
 to eating. < br / > < br / > i need foods that i can carry with me that do n't taste like cardboard . i have been <unknown> the internet and ran across these bars . i picked some up and was pleasantly surprised. < br / > < br / > good flavor , good texture , a little more fiber than most and on top of it , chocolate . yea ! ! ! ! < br / > < br / > not your typical gluten free , low sugar food . good stuff !
 i love this coffee , and it was great to have around when i could n't have caffeine or sugar . but now it costs more than double what i paid when i bought it in the market last year . it has disappeared from the grocery market almost completely , then <unknown> under maxwell house on amazon for double the price . i 'm looking for something else .
 it was the <unknown> red beets which played an important role in her recovery . the red beets are a great natural <unknown> and helped get rid of the toxins in her system from all the medications . it also helped strengthen her immune system . at the very beginning of her treatment she was sleeping most of the time , but after adding the red beets to her diet , she had more energy and was more active . lily is doing well now and will continue to receive <unknown> to make sure she remains in good health .
 i give my dog a variety of healthy and organic treats . these are his favorite and he knows by the package !
 got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party , so i have n't actually tasted them . the lollipops are cute . . . the wrappers have writing on them , which i wish they did n't ( would have been much <unknown> without the writing ) . they are a bit smaller than i expected ( just slightly larger than a regular lollipop ) , and a few arrived broken , but really , they were well packaged , and looked cute for the party .
 i use <unknown> in my gluten free flour mix . it adds a bit of body and chewiness to cookies and brownies . it seems to help with the moisture too , as i find many gluten free baked goods are dry and gritty without a little sweet rice flour added .
 this is the best lemon cookie that i have ever tasted . i bought a box at a <unknown> store and then never saw the product again . i went on to amazon and bought a case three weeks ago . between my friends and i they are gone. < br / > i am going to buy another case .
 entire can <unknown> . `` < br / > < br / > the cans are all perfectly sealed and the almonds are always fresh - what else can you ask for ? the cost is also lower than in local stores , but you can buy the larger bags cheaper ( per oz ) from some <unknown> if you can find them. < br / > < br / > almonds are supposed to be appetite <unknown> , but for me it 's usually because i ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more .
 excellent healthy product for your small dogs ! please be aware that you must watch your pup when giving them this small greenie or they will swallow the entire thing in one gulp ! ! quick service by the seller and excellent price for this product ! i will purchase more for sure ! !
 i love this coffee . this was first given to me as a gift from a relative who visited costa rica , and i loved it so much that i had to find it . the coffee has a great flavor , and is not overly robust or overly mild .
 i received what i ordered faster than expected , item was in great condition ... i love the strong taste of this coffee . i will definitely buy this item again .
 this is my favorite <unknown> coffee ' so far . i 've used a french press , various drip makers , and have a keurig at my desk at work -- but , if i was in a rush , i 'd definitely be fine with drinking this stuff on the go . right out of the frig it 's flavorful , refreshing , has enough caffeine to get you going in the morning , and is low-calorie and <unknown> . i normally do n't buy products like this but am seriously considering it after enjoying my free sample .
 eat later will taste right . the effect goes away after about a day , too. < br / > < br / > sounds like an awful lot of fuss just to have sour belts , huh ? but if you like sour like i like sour , it 's definitely worth it. < br / > < br / > these belts are not delivered in a hard plastic case , but in a clear plastic bag . you get a lot of them ! store them in a resealable container to keep them soft and fresh .
 i grew up with <unknown> candy bars . i have not seen them in stores in a long time . when i saw them on amazon i thought i would try them again . they arrived as fresh as expected and they bring back lots of great memories ! i will continue to order from amazon confident they will be fresh and a great price !
 ingredients good for dog with wheat allergies . i use them for training and the size , a small bone shape about 1 '' long , is good . they are soft enough to break in half , but not so soft as to make a mess or crumble easily . training for obedience , <unknown> & agility means we do lots of training and need a variety of small treats that are easy to carry ... . these fit the bill .
 we like the much harder to find `` white '' popcorn over the more common `` yellow '' popcorn and amish country baby white is our absolute favorite . we usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly .
 br / > < br / > there is very little rice compared with the amount of grease and spices ( strong taste of pumpkin pie spices like cinnamon and clove ) and it just does n't taste very good . the <unknown> oz package says it is two servings but is really only one serving -- and has twenty four grams of fat , 10 of them saturated fat , and <unknown> calories . i did enjoy the free indian music cd , but that comes with their other food items as well . pass this one up !
 gloria jean coffee has always been good in my experience and this is no exception . <unknown> flavorful while still tasting like coffee .
 nervous about even eating any of the bottles . after going through and tossing several , we decided to keep the remainder and <unknown> them in canning jars to help preserve them . the ginger is sliced fairly thick and we have to cut it down to make it <unknown> for eating on our sushi . all in all , the flavor is decent , but a lot of tedious work to get to that point . in the future , we will either can our own or try and find a local carrier to buy our sushi ginger .
 chewy chips ahoy and keebler soft batch are very similar taste and texture . i decided to try this since a had a coupon for 50 % off . they 're slightly smaller than chips ahoy , but that 's about it . my cookies arrived a little crumbled due to shipping , but no complaints because they were still edible and tasted great . great cookies , and now i have a <unknown> of them : ) .
 my dog loves this <unknown> cleaner . her teeth were cleaned <unknown> within 2 weeks . we like the ingredients and it 's made in the usa . costco used to supply the item , but no longer . great product .
 it is nearly impossible to find jerky anywhere that is n't <unknown> with sugar , or dextrose ( same thing ! ) . i was so glad to find this jerky , and when i ordered it i wondered if it would be any good . mystery solved : this is fantastic ! it has a great spicy kick to it , one that does n't linger though . and knowing that it 's turkey , you know you 're eating a fairly healthy snack , too . love this stuff , i 'm hooked !
 in this , so we know it 's not gluten free . ( i have yet to find a <unknown> 's food product that was actually gluten free , although some of them are legally gluten free . look for their name on the labels so you know what to avoid , even if they are hiding behind the federal law and they have labeled their products gf . ) < br / > < br / > pacific rice milk and whole foods ' store brands of rice milk are gluten free , though . buy those instead .
 . before , i was just using oil to do the job , which was very successful . many different <unknown> said that i needed to try these paramount crystals to help the chocolate hold to the cake pops . my attempt with these paramount crystals was a near disaster ... several of the pops started to sweat through the chocolate and on others the chocolate cracked , both of which had never happened on the hundreds of cake <unknown> that i had made with oil in the chocolate . needless to say , i switched back to oil .
 your head and get you ready to <unknown> < br / > i also love that there is less packaging . i must admit to a bit of guilt over the whole k-cup <unknown> situation . ( i make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them ! ) these do not have the plastic outer cup . i keep them in a plastic container with a sealed lid instead of in the k-cup carousel to keep them fresher . but i got ta tell you -- opening that lid yields the most wonderful coffee aroma .
 i finally kicked my addiction to soda three months ago , but still want to enjoy beverages with flavor . i love that it has just a tiny bit of sugar ( and calories ) , but it has <unknown> of antioxidants ! i 've only tried the peach so far , but i really like it . it 's a bit hard to find in most chain grocery stores , so i appreciate that i can get it through `` subscribe and save '' .
 i love this company and i love their products , but this particular flavor combo just does n't work . there is a nice vinegar tang up front , but the jelly donut aroma and sweetness is downright odd . it was a nice idea , but i 'm sticking with the good old malt vinegar variety .
 have to return all 6 cans or just the 3 damaged ones . not happy . the box is small and suprisingly heavy , so the shipper probably dropped it ( or it fell off the top of other packages in the truck during shifting in transit because of its weight ) -- like i said , it 's heavy , yet small . this was not marked on the outside as a food item , or fragile , or at the very least , it should be marked as heavy , so that the shipper can be warned .
 . ... it 's either this or the concentrate , and they do n't sell the concentrate on amazon for a reasonable price . ... one last thing : this is a fantastic product , but if you have a toys r <unknown> r us anywhere in your vicinity , it 's worth driving to get the concentrate . it 'll save you about $ 16 per two cases , which for us means about $ 8-10 per week . ( one case of concentrate provides the same amount of food as two cases of ready to feed . )
 it was a cross between <unknown> chemically and sort of like the smell in the vitamin aisle of a <unknown> store . it 's was n't absolutely <unknown> but just not my favorite and thankfully it <unknown> quite a bit after my hair was dried and <unknown> < br / > < br / > i give this <unknown> stars . i like this enough that i would buy more in the future. < br / > < br / > sincere thanks to amazon and the <unknown> who gave me the opportunity to give this product a try .
 this are just the best gummi cherries ever ! < br / > i tryed them in santa <unknown> , <unknown> and took me a <unknown> to find them good thing amazon has them , so if u like cherry flavor this are the ones < br / > -- -- -- <unknown> -- -- -- -- -
 great matcha powder , ideal for making <unknown> . the only problem was the delivery , the package got lost for a couple of days ( not the sellers fault ) . aside from that , excellent product , i really recommend it . : )
 after 9 years in italy we <unknown> for olives of high quality and flavor . we were very pleased with this <unknown> . we will certainly buy these again and again !
 plant arrived as described , small but very braided trunks look great , arrived on time and the price was very reasonable
 him the breeder had him on purina puppy chow . the first thing i wanted to do was to switch him to a high quality , no grain diet and after alot of research and reviews , taste of the wild always came on top ( dollar wise ) . after the switch i immediately noticed a difference in my <unknown> coat is starting to shine and is sooooo soft to the touch . he has so much energy now and he has less eye <unknown> and less ear odor ( due to being allergic to the <unknown> ) .
 at nearly a dollar for a 8.3 oz can . the only <unknown> ingredient is ascorbic acid as a <unknown> < br / > < br / > bottom line : i 'd say its worth buying . its a refreshing drink that does n't leave you feeling guilty or crashing from a sugar high later. < br / > < br / > my only criticism is , it needs more cherry flavor . i 'd recommend a higher dose of cherry concentrate and substituting some pear juice for grape juice because pear has a more neutral flavor .
 not enough flavor , <unknown> brown color , lacking in aroma . i enjoy other varieties from this line but prefer a different brand of rose hip tea . i 'd drink it over regular black tea though .
 this coffee is a great deal ! all the coffee drinkers in the house enjoy it - will purchase again . compared to many others we have tried this is in the top 5 .
 with hundreds of common house flies all about for 24 hours and not a single one caught i resorted to a fly <unknown> and killed 50 or so in 1-2 hours with my old fly <unknown> . this fly trap appears useless .
 so chocolaty and spiced just right ! i decided to try this brand after reading all the wonderful reviews . i 'd never had spiced hot chocolate before - just the plain store-bought instant kind . wow ! the flavor of this just blew me away ! best cup of hot chocolate i 've ever tasted ! ! i 'm hooked ! !
 im learning that latin american and south american coffees have this distinct `` coffee '' <unknown> finish . as a peets coffee fanatics we learned that <unknown> roaster was the roaster for peet 's and we are hooked ! i already <unknown> the french and organic blend , but i must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink. < br / > met the <unknown> team at the <unknown> brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast . since them we are <unknown> < br / > you wont be dissapointed !
 i received my shipment today , and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings . only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly . i even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing . i carefully followed directions for each bag . if i could rate this , a zero i would .
 trouble when left at home alone . he drags this toy around by the hard rubber ball part , then lays it flat on the floor , pushing and pulling the rubber rope until he empties it . the other dogs just watch , but never attempt it themselves . it is easy to refill except i struggle sometimes with lining up the <unknown> on the screw-on lid . it washes well in the dishwasher . i recommend this toy for every dog , but many dogs will need a little <unknown> therapy to learn how to use it .
 love the hershey 's kisses ! i bought them at a very good price ( $ 19 ) with a $ 5 discount they cost me $ 14 . i may order them again when the price goes down .
 with the texture of <unknown> and a wonderful honey and almond taste , <unknown> is absolute heaven .
 pull results in a coffee that is not strong enough and is slightly watery ... the 4 oz way is definitely much stronger but still is far from bold or full-bodied . i still prefer my < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> cafe <unknown> < /a > which gives me the <unknown> of using whichever beans i prefer . one of my favorites ( besides some local roasters ) is < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > lavazza super crema < /a > which is a much bolder and full-bodied coffee .
 i was disappointed to find that the beans came whole . since i do n't own a fancy coffee machine like french snobs or a fancy grinder , i did n't know how to use them . i tried to smash them with a hammer but they were inconsistent . when i did manage to <unknown> a grinder from a homeless man , i found that the coffee tasted like poo .
 and this is no exception . it is not the worst offender either , though . the cashews largely survived the journey to my home intact and it took a good bit of munching to get down to the cashew flavored salt crumbles at the <unknown> < br / > < br / > if you love cashews , you 'll love these . the fact that salt is the only thing i can complain about is really a <unknown> to how good this <unknown> brand still is . grab your top <unknown> and cane and enjoy a canister .
 these chips were amazingly delicious ! < br / > these olive chips were thin , crispy , <unknown> , yet not too salty. < br / > my 2 year old son loved them . the best part of these chips is the fact that they ( chips ) are super healthy. < br / > these chips are also small enough for your little ones to enjoy and eat easily. < br / > i highly recommend these chips for any occasion , especially to place in your or your little ones ' lunch box .
 they worked perfectly for what i needed them for ! ( decoration ) otherwise , they are very very sweet ! <unknown> inducing almost lol
 i was very happy with the quick delivery of this product and how fresh the beans were . i am looking forward to my homemade vanilla extract once it is done brewing . i would definitely buy from this seller again .
 bbq = very tasty. < br / > < br / > original = not that tasty. < br / > < br / > cheddar is okay and the sweet potato , if you can find it , is light on flavor but good none the less. < br / > < br / > go with bbq . you wont regret it . probably .
 this cocoa is very good . i love it , so does my son . i actually like to mix half coffee with this cocoa , very tasty . and my son likes the flavor , and the fact that it is low in carbs .
 the coffee is good . however , at least half of these have n't been sealed correctly . when i brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere . not fun to clean . it may have just been the batch we got , but i wo n't be ordering these again .
 my cat loves milk , but because of the side effects quit cat milk . it just depends on your cat . some cats really ca n't handle milk products . my cat does n't touch this anymore .
 my one dog who has allergies has been on this food now for a year and is doing so great - his improvement is amazing ! no more red skin , itching , and his energy is so much better . i think going with a grain-free dog food with a lean meat ( venison ) was extremely beneficial . only the best ingredients inside , and apparently the taste is great too ! this food improved the quality of my dog 's life .
 cat not my <unknown> . anyway , we started supplementing his food with newman 's own and i swear the cat looks 2 years younger . he is more active , his eyes have cleared up , and he has lost weight . the vet is amazed as well , as his sugar levels are better . i am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a vet has suggested . but if you have an animal who is not <unknown> well , it is worth a try to add this product to their diet .
 this produces a nice strong cup of coffee . i prefer strong <unknown> k-cups usually result in weaker brews . the usual problem with starbucks is they are pretty expensive . but this deal for around <unknown> a cup is a very good deal , usually starbucks brand k-cups sell for about 1 $ a cup. < br / > < br / > update : on the ones sold by warehouse deals : the best before on those is <unknown> 2012 , so all those <unknown> start drinking !
 i tried the lemonade as it was recommended in the `` eat this not that '' series as i was concerned about the amount of sugar in normal lemonade and juice . absolutely the best lemonade out there !
 i 've tried 3 different recipes with carbquik . i used it to bread <unknown> just barely ok . the biscuits i tried were terrible . the dumplings for chicken and dumplings were a mess . they did n't hold together when i put them in the boiling chicken broth to cook . i had to <unknown> the doughy mess and order dinner out . the mix its self has a peculiar odor that is unappetizing . i would n't recommend buying this product .
 this was one of the best purchases i 've done in years ! it was well wrapped , moist and is a very pretty little tree . some people <unknown> the name and call it : <unknown> <unknown> means to kill . bonsai ( bone sigh ) means <unknown> plant in a <unknown> ' . this the correct sound . it is relaxing and very comforting creating and taking care of these <unknown> . i highly recommend it to anyone who needs to <unknown> their life <unknown> !
 wow ! these are amazingly tasty ! addictive , even . i only wish they were easier to find !
 i love this flavor , it is the same price as walmart , but this is easier , plus you get 72 , hard to find 72 at walmart all one flavor
 bought a can yesterday from a local store . the expiration was 2013 , but it really smelled bad ! what am i supposed to do now ? open every single can and do a smell test before buying ?
 bottle seems to be an issue with most of the reviewers here . the shampoo arrived wrapped in plastic , and then in bubble wrap . the bottle has one of those <unknown> lids , which is simply too loose to seal properly for shipment . i did n't lose as much of the product as some reviewers did , but the bottle was a sticky mess that had to be cleaned off before using. < br / > < br / > bottom line , this is a <unknown> shampoo that left my hair feeling soft and full .
 br / > < br / > <unknown> , i see other tempting varieties : asian sides , <unknown> sides and more , and all just as easy to prepare as the stroganoff ( see previous review ) . < br / > < br / > excuse me , i 'm off to the kitchen again . these are so easy , so delicious , i may never `` cook '' again. < br / > < br / > reviewed by : betty <unknown> , 2008 < br / > author of : <unknown> babe : the <unknown>
 the tasty results , but these can not be used in a <unknown> popper . we tried them in our our new presto and they just fell out in to the bowl uncooked . called presto ; they immediately knew what was wrong - `` are you using a gourmet corn that is small ? there is not enough weight for them to be exposed to the hot air long enough ... ... ! '' this is not the seller 's fault but be aware you ca n't pop these in - at least - a presto <unknown> popper .
 i have a 5 month old australian shepherd and she could not get the treats out -- we could n't either . what we finally ended up doing was boring a hole at the bottom ; luckily my husband had the tools to make a smooth hole big enough for her kibbles . it now works very well as a treat dispenser , but my dog does n't really play with it like a toy .
 this toy is great ! my dog loves it ! i feed my dog his food in it so he does n't eat too fast . at the beginning it took sometime for him to learn how to get the treats out but now he eats a whole cup in 15 minutes or so .
 this tea is a wonderful treat on a cold night . the cinnamon aroma is very enticing . i have been buying this for years and amazon always has the best price .
 absolutely delicious ! my husband ( on a low-carb plan ) uses this in his coffee with some cream . it has really kept him satisfied and not wanting to go to `` the '' coffee shop for his favorite caramel latte . it does n't have a fake sugar aftertaste and really adds the caramel flavor he loves . great product and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting less sugar with great taste !
 you just mix with water for me it is a little hard to swallow , i blend up frozen blueberry 's and strawberry 's which i thaw and add 2/3 cup water mix with powder in a shaker pretty good stuff you can also leave berries frozen to make shake thicker and more like a milk shake if you add powder to blender to mix it will be a little foamy that 's why i mix it in a shaker if you decide to buy it try different ways till you find the way you like to drink it !
 quaker 's soft baked banana nut bread is delicious ! gave it a <unknown> spin in the microwave and enjoyed an extremely tasty , warm treat to start the day . banana nut bread is a personal fav dessert for me , but generally high <unknown> -- this bar has a good weight and taste for just 140 calories , 5g of fiber , and 6g of protein . this turned out to be a surprisingly tasty and healthy breakfast or snack option . definitely going to pick up another box or two on my grocery run this week .
 blue <unknown> chai got it right with this powdered mix . do n't <unknown> this chai -- it is superb ! would even describe it as sublime . the combination of tea and spices is well <unknown> . what you have is a clean , soft , warm , and spicy balance of flavors . with a cup of this hot chai , it will leave you feeling mellow yet energized . nothing but praises for this royal treat .
 unlike the illy cappuccino this caffe ' has a strong robust flavor and not too sweet . it does have a bitter finish which i kind of like and is the nature of espresso . i enjoyed this product , it 's a nice little afternoon pick me up . wish the 6.8 ounce can was bigger but then again , everyone having to put up with me <unknown> off the walls might feel differently ! very good caffe ' !
 . he was able to chew on each treat for a few hours before he reduce it to nothing . another nice thing i that it does not have any artificial dyes or colorings , which is important because 1 ) our dog is allergic to them 2 ) they can stain your carpet and <unknown> < br / > < br / > final verdict - our dog really seems to like them - and with any luck the digestive enzymes will do him a little good too ! < br / > < br / > 5 stars
 my two dogs love this product , and it is all organic <unknown> of newman 's dog foods are good for your dog <unknown> them a try <unknown> them in good health .
 < br / > < br / > when i received these product , they were in an excellent condition . considering that these are <unknown> , i got them still fresh and got them the way the seller had <unknown> them . the packaging was neat and was absolutely done carefully . the price for me is reasonable because you just can not find these stuff in some groceries at least here in texas . nice doing business with the seller . so over all rating , i give both the seller and the product a 5-star rating .
 we use these for dogs and they love them , so we bought some for a friend 's sick dog . he also loves them .
 the <unknown> family company continues to be a tremendous <unknown> of local schools . as principal of <unknown> <unknown> , i appreciate the <unknown> and <unknown> this company has shown us . a few years back they donated $ <unknown> to our school and most recently they provided our staff a one cup coffee maker and samples of these wonderful keurig coffees . my favorite is the french roast . strong flavor with a smooth finish . please support this company by purchasing their coffee .
 my chihuahua loves this food . i alternate between this and natural balance most of the time . out of the 2 , she definitely prefers this one . it 's a little on the expensive side , but i do n't mind paying it b/c of how good it is for her .
 if your toddler is a good eater , these are a very good deal price wise . i paid $ 3.29 for one at my local store. < br / > < br / > that said , my granddaughter will not eat the chicken bits . i tasted them and ... not so hot ! she eats the veggies and mashed potatoes and that is it . she is somewhat a picky eater but i am not sure it is her problem . i did n't like the chicken either .
 tea which seemed to be overpowered by the fruit flavors and the honey . using it as directed , one packet to one 16.9 oz bottle of water , produced a very intense flavor . using a little less than one packet , or a larger water bottle , provided a better taste for me . if one likes very sweet , use the whole stick . the powder mixes quickly after shaking <unknown> for about 30 seconds . i liked it enough to get it again . it 's one of the better water <unknown> i 've tried .
 love the taste . they are low in calories and better than other chips . satisfies my sweet cravings . give them a try
 my daughter loves earth best jar food . she is very picky about the taste so their varity comes in very handy .
 we use a lot of organic maple syrup and this was a brand recommended and amazon subscribe and save had the best per ounce price ! i love not having to think about stocking up on items i buy all the time !
 i tried these in colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast . amazon did n't sell the ones i wanted . i put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one . within a week of their birthday , amazon e-mailed me that it was available . great chips but , took longer to ship then expected . just in the <unknown> of time for the birthday . when you want something real bad , amazon usually comes through .
 half <unknown> kiwi , dehydrated half sliced mango , dehydrated sliced papaya with lime , dehydrated pineapple <unknown> , dehydrated whole strawberries , banana chips , dried tart cherries , <unknown> < br / > < br / > the ingredients have additional sweetening , flavoring , coloring and preservatives in the form of sugar , citric acid , <unknown> & c coloring , sulfur dioxide , juices , salt , oils and `` artificial flavor '' . < br / > < br / > it makes for a very tasty blend but not pure in any way .
 my son liked the taste and has a nice thick texture . but he was sooooo gassy after eating this there is no way i can feed him the rest that i bought .
 jar . these <unknown> are designed to fit a variety of glass baby food jars and protect the glass while traveling or storing . the <unknown> <unknown> the glass jar against <unknown> and bumps while in the diaper bag or <unknown> as well as giving added protection against occasional drops . the <unknown> can be reused over and over again and are dishwasher , freezer and microwave safe . <unknown> are also <unknown> and bpa free. < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > <unknown> <unknown> for glass baby food jars , <unknown> , 2 pack < /a >
 i loved this mold ! i wished i could have used it for more than one occasion , but it did n't last . i did use it to make <unknown> suckers for my daughter 's first birthday . but there was going to be no way that the mold could be <unknown> after that . i would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions , but for the price it did n't matter to me that much . it served it 's main purpose : )
 crunchy . came packaged well . if you are thinking they are going to be like <unknown> , you would be wrong . they are very mild flavored . they are ok , but nothing i would crave for sure .
 stash 's peach black tea has the perfect balance of peach and strong black tea flavor for a very refreshing summer drink . i usually use one or two peach tea bags along with 2 family sized black tea bags of the grocery store variety . this makes 2 quarts of great iced tea , with just a hint of peach . when i want something special i will use only the peach black tea and serve with a slice of peach . summer is coming so i just stocked up !
 never gave much thought to this treat until <unknown> <unknown> came to town ... awesome have a big ole candy dispenser at work with a big <unknown> sticker on it ... now we have <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> cajun style ...
 these are great little candies that are sugar free and satisfy your black licorice craving . they are good for work b/c you can put one in your mouth like a mint and it lasts for awhile . very flavorful with a true black licorice taste and no weird sugar free aftertaste !
 i have two cocker <unknown> that are absolutely crazy over greenies , we have to spell it out and they still know what it is ! all i know is that if it makes my dogs this happy then it makes me happy !
 try . my cats love the extra gravy ! they love the chicken chunks too , of course but the gravy really got them going . i 've now tried several other varieties with gravies and they could n't be more enthusiastic . i switched them from all dry food to mostly wet and a little dry because the oldest cat was constantly throwing up ... likely from her unable to effectively chew dry food well and swallowing it whole . i will continue to order this for them as well as some of the other petite cuisine varieties .
 flavonoids , which is more than cranberry juice and almost twice that in orange juice . from an internet reference , `` flavonoids have antioxidant activity . flavonoids are becoming very popular because they have many health promoting effects . tea flavonoids have many health benefits . tea flavonoids reduce the oxidation of <unknown> <unknown> , lowers the blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides . `` < br / > < br / > to summarize , i enjoyed this drink and would purchase it again . it is convenient , tasty , and provides a few health benefits .
 <unknown> is a great product . it tastes delicious , not fruity and is lo cal . a perfect beverage after working out . red bull and monster are so heavy ... like a weight in your stomach . <unknown> is a refreshing recovery beverage . who wants to fill full after a workout ? not me !
 i ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for christmas . he loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own . delivery was good , i had it in several days but still in plenty of time for christmas . would recommend to anyone .
 act ii salt with the oil , be careful not to use too much of the salt . it seems to be concentrated . it does n't take as much as you might <unknown> < br / > < br / > if i could have these people send me their supply that they obviously do n't know how to use , i 'd be in heaven ! < br / > < br / > i 'm buying myself a <unknown> popper for christmas , just so i can have this popcorn more often than once a month !
 not the best product for the price . i got these for my dog that has plaque problems but i have n't really seen any improvement since we got them . they are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque i do n't think they work at all .
 i was extremely impressed with the single serve pecan pies . i expected a middle of the road product , thought i 'd give them a try. < br / > the ratio of filling to crust thickness is perfect . pie has a rich home baked flavor , and the size is wonderful . <unknown> is large enough to enjoy without ruining diet . it 's satisfying without being overly sweet. < br / > i will be ordering more next month to give one to each guest to take home after thanksgiving dinner .
 the miso is delicious ; its an easy way to have a quick breakfast . i have an egg with the soup , and eat something else at lunch time . the miso in the morning is very light , and not heavy on the stomach .
 this is a very delicious <unknown> mix . i add a pound or so of browned , drained breakfast sausage after it is heated and serve over <unknown> . it is super fast and easy . i serve with cut up fresh fruit and there you have a simple , quick breakfast or brunch meal ! i would highly recommend .
 are not going to taste like good cheesecake because 1 ) they are not refrigerated , 2 ) they are 100 calorie and good cheesecake is probably 1,000 calories a slice ! and 3 ) they are plain instead of flavored like turtle or strawberry . i did not find them to be grainy or dry but a soft , chewy bar . i like to eat one along with a strawberry cheesecake yogurt , yum ! all in all i think they are good but i would not pay more for them than the average granola type bar .
 very interesting product to get delivered directly to the house . <unknown> fun to have . but be warned -- it is not alcohol free . this is a fermented product .
 the other reviewers did n't like these marzipan rum balls , but i thought i 'd try them anyway . well , they were right , so add me to the list of disappointed buyers . they were artificial tasting and lacked any marzipan flavor .
 these are little airy and delicious nuggets of goodness ... except of course , they are n't nuggets , lol . really though , these chips are nice and crunchy while also being light and airy . the salt and vinegar flavor is just right ... not too strong , but never lacking . actually , my only real complaint is that i find it difficult to stop eating them . however , that is simply my cross to <unknown> < br / > < br / > enjoy !
 it was worth trying it . ordered april , 2011 and expiration on the cans is november 2011 . not sure if that is typical in the store as i only buy 1 can at a time there . i have the extras stored in a cool , dark area of my cupboard , so i am sure they will be fine even after the expiration date . will make sure not to order the next case too early , though ! great price ( about 50 % of what i would pay local ) , free shipping . nice
 will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them . she knows if we talk about them so we have to call them g 's to each other . she will tolerate other treats if i 'm waiting for an order from amazon , but she does n't like it . the only downfall is the price . i can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on amazon and so i 'll stock up on them when i can . if i ca n't , she has to wait and substitute with something else .
 the taste of this drink did n't really knock me out ; there 's not quite enough black cherry to completely disguise the apple juice base . and there was almost a very slight taste of salt ... though this may be more a factor of the carbonation that any actual ingredient . overall , not an unpleasant drink - but not one i 'd seek out when there are other choices .
 i should have been more aware of the price at local stores for this product . walgreens had these exact almonds for $ 2 <unknown> bag that week . they are delicious , though .
 i love maldon salt . i discovered it when we visited england and had carefully <unknown> my box until my daughter , when visiting england brought me back a box. < br / > < br / > maldon salt is large square bowls of salt mixed with big broken chunks , perfect for on top of bread or <unknown> < br / > < br / > and the two boxes are a great idea , the two should last possible the entire year making it a great deal for a wonderful luxury .
 i was ready to buy it , but passed it up . why ? because it has corn syrup in it . corn syrup has been linked to obesity and diabetes . for all the benefits of pomegranate juice , you lose it with the corn syrup .
 pretzels have been improperly stored and/or prepared with <unknown> ingredients , they have an off taste like rancid vegetable oil . i gave two stars instead of one because amazon did try twice and refunded both times . interestingly , i have bought this product before when it was available in the seattle area and it was excellent . there is obviously a <unknown> problem going on somewhere along the line .
 tasty , small kernel popcorn . however , too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper . the kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped .
 this tea is very tasty . i love it at night with a little soy milk and splenda ! ! would recommend this for people trying to up their healthy green tea <unknown> .
 <unknown> flavor of a lot of other energy sodas. < br / > < br / > i typically do n't drink this kinds of things , <unknown> coffee when i need a boost in the morning , but this was n't too bad . if you are an energy drink person and regularly pound monster or rockstar or red bull , etc . it might be worth giving this a shot . it 's got the caffeine of about <unknown> cups of coffee and is a nice flavor alternative to some of the other energy drinks out there .
 it is the best mint jelly on the planet . i bought the six-pack and will put the extra in the <unknown> and use for gifts . great with new zealand lamb !
 alternative for preventing dental carries . ( see wikipedia ) recommendations are to have at least 6 grams of xylitol daily for full efficacy . at that rate , you would need to consume 35 pieces of this gum for it to be <unknown> < br / > < br / > also this gum contains other products such as sorbitol which <unknown> the effects of the xylitol . i would look into other products such as & lt ; ... > or <unknown> or <unknown> for pure xylitol gum . this trident gum is only a marketing scam .
 of all the starbucks coffees , i like the italian roast the best . partly because i 'm italian , and partly because the smokey flavor is n't over <unknown> and the dark roast is n't too acidic . i hope they never drop this flavor .
 i have n't had any problems with this tea so i am a notch above <unknown> . i do n't regret buying it .
 these are the best snack food ever ! spicy and healthy . the <unknown> packs are a blessing 'cause i could <unknown> on them . the only drawback is they make your fingers messy , but that 's a small price to pay .
 / > and also people said that the coffee packets came in all messed up and it looked like they just threw it in the box. < br / > not true . mine came in a amazon box and inside is another box and the receipt . inside the smaller box is the via container that is just like the picture . all little packets were still inside the starbucks packet. < br / > < br / > i would def ignore all those negative comments because this is a pretty good product to order ! = )
 for over 10 years ( at a previous <unknown> <unknown> equipment business ) , of which was amazing ! this product is not . on a scale of <unknown> , i 'd rate it about a 2 . it is edible ; although extremely salty . tastes nothing like <unknown> style popcorn , severely lacking in butter flavor . the only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself . so if you 're used to buying cheap <unknown> , over the stove style popcorn , this would be better . i would not recommend .
 of a slightly burned roasted peanut . i 'm sure the product is a great one for what it is , but i just ca n't see using it as a substitute for <unknown> peanut butter. < br / > < br / > i gave it three stars because the texture , when mixed with water , has a nice consistency , and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix . i also think that it would be great for baking ... maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery <unknown> coating .
 this marinade tastes sooo good but i have a really sensitive stomach , so my stomach did n't take it so well . it was so worth it though . i 'm going to try the original one and see if it 's less spicy . i ca n't stay away from this stuff completely , it 's just too good !
 <unknown> badly needs to filter their yerba leaves in their existing products or offer a different label with pure , refined leaf . other yerba mate ' vendors offer this and it is a gaping hole in <unknown> 's product line . even though this product is more affordable than the rest of the <unknown> yerba mate ' line , it is still very expensive compared to other organic and traditional yerba mate ' labels from other companies . an adjustment to competitive pricing as well as attention to filtering the yerba leaves would give this product 5 stars .
 if you like really strong ginger flavor you 'll likely enjoy this , but if you were looking for a beverage with ginger and lemon flavor , look elsewhere . it 's advertised as a ginger & lemon drink , but it 's mostly ginger . i did n't notice any lemon flavor at all , and honestly , i could n't finish it . that was really disappointing , as i like both ginger and lemon and was hoping for a drink that was a nice blend of the two .
 this like yummy homemade hot cocoa , with the benefit of being a delicious cup of coffee , too ! this is a great deal ! get it while it lasts ! good to the last drop , you could say ! < br / > enjoy !
 <unknown> in my city <unknown> <unknown> and stealing babies . i do n't know who came up with the horrible horrible horrible idea to discontinue selling the physical <unknown> of delicious . for the last few weeks i 've been eating cocoa puffs trying to <unknown> like everything was okay . well you know what ? it was n't okay . eating cocoa puffs in place of count chocula is like dating a girl that looks sort of like the woman you love . you 're only fooling yourself . count chocula is the best cereal ever . period .
 the # 4 ingredient was ... . nothing . there are only 3 ingredients . i actually flipped the wrapper over to see the <unknown> of the ingredients list before i realized that there was no more list ! < br / > < br / > these bars are a little expensive for a <unknown> energy bar , but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing . its simply incredible , and now i have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out , too .
 i love this product , it helps keep things moving ! i use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting . a great product for helping maintain your weight .
 i was tired of getting bags of assorted chocolate candy that always had a variety no one would eat . i love that amazon was selling this product and it came in `` bulk '' . i wo n't run out of the office candy again ! i went ahead and bought all of the favorite brands so i can keep everyone happy .
 this is my second time ordering this brand . the first time they were fine , this time they are dark and <unknown> . they are very dry and they have dust or mold on them .
 <unknown> bay coffee is great love this stuff . flavor is very good flavor dark but not bitter will buy again
 brick . they were awful , and we ended up throwing them away . a real bummer ... <unknown> great cheeseburger on a bun is the thing i miss most being a celiac ! do try their coffee cake , though . it was fantastic , and you only add water and microwave for a minute ! feels like cheating in the morning , and perfect for those in a rush . be sure and do n't throw the baking container away , as it looks like you can order just the refills without the container for less money .
 this bread is the answer for my husband 's `` need '' for bread . i also add different herbs and spices for some change . he loves the onion powder and italian seasonings and the <unknown> . great product !
 how to achieve potato chip nirvana ? it 's simple : buy these chips , get them tomorrow , eat them ! < br / > <unknown> < br / > < br / > why ? < br / > < br / > best `` old school '' bbq flavor out there < br / > kettle quality < br / > incredible price with amazon < br / > < br / > did i mention delicious and a terrific bargain ?
 i just bought five of these <unknown> of gatorade for $ 30.00 total at sam 's club . do n't waste your money buying this here .
 as good as any in grocery stores and more reasonably priced . but , you do have to get a carton of them .
 these are the best beer sausages i , ve come across in decades ! they taste just like the old time sausages i used to get in bars when i was younger . if you wont take my word for it just ask 3 of my friends ! !
 himalayan salt is mined from the mountains in <unknown> and is said to be 99 % pure and over <unknown> years old . it is beautiful looking as well as tasting and i have been <unknown> by this new discovery .
 in very bad shape ... very skinny , lethargic , and his fur was very wiry ! we got him on the <unknown> with a visit to the vet and some antibiotics . but it was n't until we started feeding him science diet that we noticed the change in his fur . it made such a vast difference ! he has the softest fur i have ever felt on a cat ! the science diet seems to help with the hairballs , too . it is a bit expensive , but it 's worth every penny to me .
 pack . what a mistake . i ordered 2 weeks ago , but the product has not arrived . i checked my amazon account and it said the product would ship between july and august . three to four months for shipping ? how very ridiculous . i must say that this is my fault . it clearly says that in the product listing . however , i usually get everything i order from amazon.com within a couple or three days , so i did n't even think to look . buy this coffee from another vendor , please .
 that money around , this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little <unknown> < br / > < br / > simply put ( if you do n't feel like reading the wall of text up above ) , do not buy this product . it is , by far , one of , if not the , worst products i 've ever purchased in my life . and i 've bought a lot of junk . do n't buy into the false advertising . stay away . this stuff should be banned .
 i decided to try these on a whim when i saw them at the <unknown> <unknown> beer shop in <unknown> about a year ago . i have been a convert ever since ! in fact , my usage of bitters has even gone up considerably since i started using them since i like them so much ! they fall along the <unknown> lines , but have a distinctive richness and complexity . i 've used them ever since and am about to pick up multiple bottles since i hate running out !
 i bought these for my food stash in case of <unknown> so i ca n't rate how they taste . the shelf life was attractive and butter & cheese are harder to preserve so this was the alternative . the problem was that 3 of the 12 cans were dented ... so they were shipped that way or poor packaging was involved . we all know dented cans are what we avoid at the grocery store ...
 of thing goes ) , so there are n't a lot of surprises here . it 's simple to make and fairly cheesy , but i was left wishing there were a bit more cheese . i think adding some parmesan cheese would help as well , i may give this product another go round and see how that works . i ca n't say this is any better or worse than any other <unknown> dinner , so i suppose if you 're in the market for that sort of thing , this is as good as it gets .
 the new kraft velveeta chicken and broccoli skillets dinner kit is delicious ! a one skillet meal that uses creamy velveeta instead of powdered `` cheese flavoring '' ? i found this to be far superior to the hamburger helper flavor . it is rich and yummy and it makes a great , quick meal with a side salad .
 guide dog <unknown> beefy stroganoff . it r teh <unknown> <unknown> < br / > high quality , ships in a secure box from the factory within the shipping box . i reccomend using a <unknown> of philly cream cheese per box , or a large spoonful or two of sour cream , depending on your preference . : ) < br / > < br / > thank you .
 we love this peanut butter ! have n't tried it in cooking yet but will take advice to use less sugar when i do . it was not too sweet for my likes and has a very creamy texture . i like it
 i like this better than the original . its milder and great on burgers or pork as well .
 frankly looked quite <unknown> . tried a half bottle for those two , for the third time around , and they felt no effect at all ( good or bad ) . all three times , they had orange flavor and they did not down it on empty stomachs . so now two do n't want to use it any more and one is still interested . results definitely vary , therefore , but i 'd recommend newbies to try it several times in <unknown> situations before you decide to down it to prep for that truly vital meeting .
 her normal diet ( this newman 's own ) . soon her diarrhea started to come back . i took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice . after a few days her stools got much better . i gave this newman 's own a last chance and ... i just finished cleaning up my <unknown> < br / > < br / > i have no idea of why there are so many good reviews . is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or i got a bad batch ?
 this is my favorite coffee . i use it when i really want to enjoy my coffee .
 these chips are delicious and good for you . i buy the small bags and they are just right to eat with your lunch or for a snack . i would recommend them to anyone who loves chips but does n't like all the fat and calories .
 wow , my cats just love these , especially the chicken pot pie variety . they also gobble up the chinese chicken ( now <unknown> to sesame chicken ) , but the chicken pot pie is their all-time fave . i enjoy feeding my cats food that they like as long as it 's healthy , and petite cuisine is . it 's `` real '' food ( no meat by-products ) and there are n't any added dyes or preservatives .
 purchased the 2.5 oz . pkgs . of great northern popcorn . it popped up nicely . very few `` old maids '' . i did notice that a lot of moisture gathered on the sides of our popper ( the <unknown> <unknown> model ) during the popping process so i pulled the tray of popcorn out promptly . i could see if you left it in the machine , even for a few minutes , that the popcorn could absorb the moisture and lose its crunchy texture. < br / > i will definitely buy this product again .
 once you get past the bag <unknown> part , it 's all good from there . i find that this miracle noodle brand seems to be the least stinky compared to all the many other <unknown> noodles i 've tried . you have to rinse them for a good 30 seconds in cold water and then cook them with something flavorful for a few minutes to get the stink out . once the smell is gone , you 've got zero calorie noodles that taste like whatever you 've cooked them with .
 loved the keebler assortment ! they are great for kids lunches . my order arrived quickly and in good condition . i will will buy this <unknown> again !
 . maybe it is because i have high expectations based on my many , many previous <unknown> , or maybe it is because my wholly unsatisfying <unknown> with amazon customer service , but this episode leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth . although i will likely continue to purchase from amazon , i believe i will make it a point to <unknown> my local <unknown> whenever possible before i consider another amazon purchase. < br / > < br / > i love this `` think thin '' product , but buyers beware of amazon 's policy .
 love this tea , its great anytime of <unknown> nice and smooth and sweet < br / > bought it thru amazon because not many stores carry it where i <unknown> < br / > i received the order fast also < br / > thanks
 when you start one bag ... ... <unknown> n't too long when the bag is empty ... .and time to open another ... ... it 's the sweet taste in the beginning that keeps you eating them .
 good , prompt service ! my only problem , one that i took care of myself , was that one of the sugar bags seemed to have a box <unknown> cut on the package causing some of the sugar to be spilled into the shipping container . since there was n't a huge amount missing from the bag , i simply <unknown> the contents to a <unknown> bag of my own . i thought it better to do that than try shipping the item one single piece back . otherwise , i 'm completely happy with my purchase .
 this is the best tea you can buy . the english really know their tea !
 my cat absolutely loves this dry food ! it 's the only kind he will <unknown> you have a picky cat i highly suggest you try this product !
 this jerky was decent . the softness of the pieces were in general pretty good , a little on the hard time sometimes but overall soft enough to chew comfortably . they do vary a little bit within the bag so some pieces may be a bit too hard , but usually they do n't get too soft . the sweet and hot flavor tasted pretty good ; so did the teriyaki . i 'd recommend both !
 any kind , and i 've tried them all . i bought this today to make shrimp salad and it is amazing ! i did n't even have to add anything else to it . just the shrimp and the mayo . i 'd forgotten how great mayo could be since i 've cut back so much on it with the full calorie stuff . i agree it has a lot of cracked black pepper as others have mentioned , but that 's what makes it so good . ca n't wait to put it on a turkey sandwich !
 favorite pretzels i 've ever had . the taste is mild , which is what i like in a pretzel ( that 's not chocolate covered ) , and they 're just the right ratio of thickness and size , not like some that are so thick and dry that they stick in your throat , or so thin that you 're chewing <unknown> air . plus they 're actually a bit healthier than most others . unfortunately they 're also more expensive , but i 'm happy to say i always get what i pay for with these .
 in behind it . the doctor said it was <unknown> . because of a light stroke , i could not take any anti <unknown> pills any more . i purchased these sun maid tart cherries and they have worked wonders for me . i do n't know if they will work for everyone , but they have been a lifesaver for me . i do n't have any <unknown> in my knee any longer unless i do n't eat them some what regularly . i have told and given away several of these packages to my friends & relatives .
 i have n't been gluten-free my whole life , and oreos were a common dessert item i used to have . these cookies are very similar in flavor , although the cream filling is a bit more crumbly . these do have corn and soy products in them , which i 'm not fond of , but as an occasional treat is n't too horrid .
 this is a great product . it is healthy and tasty . my kids love it . we can only find plain bananas online .
 beef jerky , and was stunned when he thought it was delicious . i immediately ordered two cases of <unknown> from amazon ( much cheaper than buying them retail ) , and now my son takes one to school everyday for a midday snack . who knew there could be healthy beef jerky that tastes great ? <unknown> is awesome ! < br / > < br / > < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > <unknown> high protein snack , beef & ostrich , natural flavor , <unknown> sticks ( pack of 20 ) < /a >
 this is a great cereal , but to stay competitive amazon needs to work on thier price . trader joes normally has for $ 2.49 a box , target has frequent sales of 2/5 $ .
 the `` rope '' idea does n't really work ( well it works 1 time ) . it actually <unknown> the dispensing of the treats after your dog <unknown> it out - now the treats are stuck inside until the human <unknown> the rope back in. < br / > < br / > would not purchase again !
 kenyan is one of my favorite kinds of coffee . however , this kenyan was nothing special . nothing bad , and nothing especially great . there are so many other wonderful coffees , why settle for average . on the positive side , the coffee was <unknown> priced and arrived promptly after ordering .
 i bought a wolfgang puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites , so i ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it . this is a classic , <unknown> cup of coffee . it 's very smooth , with no bitterness . i would say that if you enjoy donut shop , tully 's kona , and caribou , you will like this blend . the label is adorable and makes me smile when i pop it in the keurig each morning .
 the `` rush '' i 'd get would be a sugar high , followed by a crash . however , i drank the no fear around <unknown> , <unknown> a small bit through the afternoon , and stayed up a few hours past my usual bedtime . i slept well and had no problem waking up the following morning. < br / > < br / > i was pretty happy with the < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > no fear < /a > , and would get it again - probably even over another brand .
 . my suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking . if you eat directly from the 1 pound bag , you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting . i 've also tried the jalepeno smokehouse and the salt & vinegar flavors from blue diamond . the jalepeno smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the habanero bbq if you 're wondering . compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable .
 these are absolutely great looking , and great tasting . they were a little pricey . shipping was slow , but that is ok because it is a wonderful product and worth the wait .
 to find at pet stores so i was happy to find them on amazon . i like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones i 've bought for her . i tried a few other brands when i stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them . you ca n't go wrong with these , they are <unknown> priced , safe , help reduce tartar , and dogs seem to love them .
 i love this product . it is so easy to make and it 's done in minutes . it has a great flavor , and i love that there are so many packs because as soon as you finish one you want another .
 the first jar of these my wife and i bought got inhaled by us the first day ! < br / > they are so flipping good you wo n't believe it. < br / > they are just spicy enough , yet sweet and tangy , with perfect crunch and freshness . do n't be afraid to buy several jars , you will go through them quickly .
 first had these delicious vegan treats when i was visiting my sister in ca and could n't find them in <unknown> ! now i can always find them on amazon ! they are tasty low fat , <unknown> protein , a bit high in sodium , portable and easy to take with me where ever i go !
 i took a chance ; it was the first time i tried a kit wine ( i make mine from <unknown> etc. ) . this wine is sooo good my wife and i were constantly testing it before it was finished <unknown> . it makes 6 gallons but after all the tasting we only were able to bottle about 4 gallons . this is great fruity tasting and refreshing wine . if you do n't want your kit i 'll buy it from you . our stock is running low .
 this tea is the best . it has such a smooth and soothing taste . i buy it by the 6 pack so i do n't have to worry about running out . i would recommend to anyone who likes black tea. < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > lipton black tea , black pearl pure long leaf , premium pyramid tea bags , 20-count boxes ( pack of 6 ) < /a >
 > < br / > update : <unknown> < br / > i did a secondary <unknown> yesterday . i did a taste test also and my wife and i loved it . my wife is the expert and she said it 's better than anything she buys . will bottle <unknown> and update again. < br / > < br / > update : <unknown> < br / > i 've bottled this and have handed it out to friends that are serious wine drinkers . they think it 's very good and my wife said order another ...
 this product would be completely incompatible with it . my other issue is that since this coffee <unknown> directly from the filter into the k cup holder on the machine , the holder will have to be washed regularly ( probably daily ) lest the coffee oils build up and change the final coffee taste even <unknown> < br / > < br / > i 'm generally happy with this product though , and probably will buy it again . with proper storage in an airtight container , i think the economical price <unknown> out the freshness issues .
 the green mountain coffee extra bold is our absolute favorite . it seems to arrive fresh and it seems to stay fresh . we had a real problem with emeril 's k-cups being stale , and not tasting right .
 this is my wife 's favorite tea , hands down . it has a great flavor with the right amount of coconut and is packaged in individual stay fresh packets .
 tastes just about as good as the can version . i 've always preferred aluminum cans over plastic bottles , but i 'll take what i can get . if the can version is a 10 , then the plastic bottled version is a 9.5 . i would say it has a very slight bitterness to it in the bottle. < br / > < br / > bottom line is , this is some really good tea and it 's healthy for you . if you want an alternative to sodas , i would definitely recommend this product .
 my box did n't include sleepytime and orange spice , and i wanted to try both of those before buying a whole box so that was a little disappointing . other than that , i 'm pleased with the variety for the price and <unknown> my <unknown> with this sampler .
 great tasting and good for you plus good bulk price . cant really get any better or beat that ! especially when you add in free shipping with prime !
 it ; it tastes like a <unknown> , very refreshing and not overly sweet and artificial like an orange soda . it is really delicious as a cold drink ! it used to be that you could only find it a finer foods market or deli , but it is getting easier to find now . also the price has come down recently since they found an american <unknown> to manufacture and sell it in the states under <unknown> to the french . also the glass bottle has a very cool shape , and feels good in your hand .
 ... and have had no complaints from serious connoisseurs . the price is only <unknown> when lindt holds its 2 for <unknown> bags @ 20 deal , but still , you are cutting it really close , and when you factor in shipping , forget it . walmart at best can only match this price through an online offer , however , with additional charges this substantially brings up the total cost. < br / > < br / > word of caution , this deal may not work for those requiring shipping in hot weather or steamy <unknown> .
 usually $ 1.99 per 12 ounce box . the regular price is about $ 4. < br / > < br / > $ <unknown> for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per <unknown> per ounce . the sale price is 17 cents per ounce . the regular price is 33 cents per <unknown> < br / > < br / > on the other hand , this should make two rice <unknown> treats with one box . starbucks sells rice <unknown> treats for $ 2 as one of their lowest priced snacks .
 the nylabones are wonderful ... i have two incredibly strong chewing labs and these bones will last at least 4 months of heavy chewing . the bones arrived on time , as promised ! the price was far lower than big box pet stores and far cheaper than the online pet <unknown> i usually frequent .
 if you can not obtain this tea locally this is an excellent product though not a better price than i can get it locally .
 this sugar is way different than the regular sugar . it has a bad after taste . also you need to use more of this to sweeten anything than the regular sugar .
 , the graham cracker is flaky and <unknown> < br / > < br / > like some of the other reviewers , some of my cookies were separating from their graham cracker bases . this did n't affect the flavor. < br / > < br / > i do n't let price affect my rating because prices can change over time , sales come and go , and your idea of value may not be the same as mine . however , the current price here , which exceeds 20 bucks for 4 boxes , seems extreme .
 ( a cheap waste of space ) , and things like `` liver flavor '' ( because they do n't want to pay for the real thing ) . i did n't just pull those ingredients out of the air - i was reading the ingredients list of purina one . it 's <unknown> < br / > < br / > do n't feed your cats trash . pay a little more to feed them good food now , and they 'll lead longer , healthier , more satisfied lives as a result . it 's worth it .
 i bought this and gave it my all . i even mixed it with real peanut butter . it was horrible and just pitched it . please do not buy . if it sounds too good to be true then it is . this was just horrible
 i love caramel and was excited when this arrived . but i am so disappointed . hardly any flavor at all , of coffee or caramel
 childhood <unknown> all over again ! i love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , but i do n't often make them because they 're rather messy . these bars solve that problem -- the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that 's in the bar . the best part is that i can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up .
 had some <unknown> issues and the vet recommended we switch to a wet food . i looked for a food where the primary ingredients were actually meat or fish . all of merrick 's flavors have meat or fish or poultry ( depending on flavor ) as the primary ingredient . my cat loves them all ! i feed him a half can mixed with water at night and in the morning . his coat is amazing ; i noticed a huge improvement in his coat and energy level when i started using this over the <unknown> dry food .
 a freezer burn unless you put the train in a freezer bag < br / > 2 ) the food that gets takes a while to blend ( like broccoli ) and gets a bit of air blended in is harder to get out of the <unknown> < br / > other than that we love the <unknown> they came also in 1oz portions ( we try to give a great variety of veggies to my son at every meal , so having option of a smaller portion that takes less space in the freezer ) would be great !
 been feeding her with this for about six month and still not bored of it . right now , <unknown> eating her food like the first time and leave a clean plate every time ... not even in the floor i found a single piece. < br / > < br / > this supplier is extremely quick so you wo n't have any delayed issues ... this was specially important for me since i live outside us. < br / > < br / > hope this review is useful since we found a treasure in this brand .
 let me start by saying <unknown> fruit is my favorite candy . that being said , this candy is amazing . i ca n't get enough of it
 just add water and <unknown> it 's peanut butter = the stuff tastes great . <unknown> on a banana ! peanut butter without the fat - who would have ever thought ?
 it 's on our regular shopping list now and has become a family staple . amazon has bulk prices for it , so it 's much cheaper here than at my local supermarket. < br / > < br / > sweet but with no cloying aftertaste , we 've tried a lot of instant ice teas , and this one is our favorite .
 this coffee may be low acid , but it leaves such an awful after-taste - like you 're drinking burnt coffee grounds . this coffee was so bad that i poured it out and made a fresh pot of what we 've been drinking . world of difference !
 say `` one thousand calories '' . so , as a snack food it 's almost as dangerous as cashews as far as i 'm <unknown> < br / > < br / > however , i found the granola taste to be <unknown> . it just did n't seem very fresh , if that makes any sense , and the chocolate chunks could n't save the day . this product just makes me want to do it myself because i know with my hand picked ingredients i could likely do better and not have to pay as much .
 these bars have a great taste ! just the right amount of chew , wonderful texture . i will be purchasing these again .
 it had way too much sugar , even though the can claims to have no sugar added . the strawberry flavor was predominant , overwhelming the kiwi almost entirely . in all , it tasted like strawberry candy . even worse -- it had a kind of <unknown> bitterness to it . if you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy , go ahead and try switch . but if not -- avoid this . i would especially not want to buy this flavor . there are better ways to get my daily vitamin c fix .
 personally , would cut the added butter or vegetable oil by 1/2 but that is a personal taste . would buy again . as i said , ikea carries this mix .
 salt is the <unknown> and the <unknown> ingredient . i paid over 5.00 for this bag , and i ca n't eat it because it 's so salty . cheddar cheese has salt in it , blue cheese has salt in it , and then the msg . this is poison in a bag .
 ? maybe it 's left over burnt flavor from the <unknown> ( not hot spicy at all ) peppers used in this product . i actually had to add <unknown> brand <unknown> sauce to this to make it slightly passable , and that did n't even help enough . i 'll never be buying this salsa ever again. < br / > beware : if you 're looking for something hot and spicy , do n't buy this . also , if you have taste buds and like eating things that taste good , also do n't buy this .
 16 ounces ) this is perfect in the $ 5 - $ 7 range . most 16 ounce treat bags cost upwards $ 10. < br / > < br / > other thoughts < br / > < br / > * just the smell gets the attention of my labrador puppy < br / > * good for training and as treat < br / > * pinch finger <unknown> < br / > < br / > treat your dog with this delightful and delicious brand . an excellent addition to any dog owner 's <unknown> .
 this quality product is my dogs favorite healthy chew treat . they enjoy the purina busy bone , immensely . they prefer this treat to rawhide chews and do not quit on the purina busy bone until it is finished .
 i fill this toy with cereal to keep my high maintenance lab occupied for hours ! he 's become very <unknown> at <unknown> pieces from the toy , but it still is a challenge for him . fabulous indestructible toy . great investment for my money !
 i am not sure if it was just my can but the formula had a very strong iron smell and taste . my baby would not eat it , i tasted it and it had an awful taste . too bad it did n't work for us .
 all my cats , but one like them . i foster cats and have 14 now . they come running at night , after i have <unknown> the litter boxes . they know it is treat time . it is a real convenience to have a box of temptations delivered to my door ... especially in the winter with the snow on the ground .
 's also a lot gentler on his hair , and we can both feel a huge difference in softness after each shower from what it was like before. < br / > < br / > and , finally , the smell . in my husband 's words : `` both brands had a chemical smell , but clear actually smells pretty good . '' as his wife , i wholeheartedly concur ! < br / > < br / > we got the first bottle for free , but we will absolutely be buying this in the future !
 this fantastic baby cereal . it 's easy to use and full of good stuff . i like it and my daughter <unknown> it !
 this is my favorite cold brew tea i 've tried . the flavor is rich ( unlike some that can be very weak ) and it has a nice <unknown> taste to it . its healthy & convenient to take anywhere , you can make it ahead or on the spot anywhere there is ice & water !
 this is a great treat for my <unknown> for training ! i am taking classes and petsmart right now and they require us to bring our own pet treats . this is such a great treat and my dog loves it . i 've had it for a very long time so it last a good amount . i will be purchasing them as soon as i am about to run out ! i recommend everyone getting this ! !
 we just tried this product , do not overcook it.. we added a little pesto and it was very good ... i did not notice an icky color , but we are used to whole grain food ... overall we had very nice wheat free meal .
 i 've used this item for quite awhile , and have chronic nausea due to digestive disorder and this is the only thing the has consistantly helped me feel better . i think it 's great ! !
 are not that many treats in the bag at all . but , keep in mind that each treat should realistically be broken up into 3-4 pieces at a <unknown> < br / > < br / > did the dogs like them ? sure they did , there was no messy `` side effects '' after digestion so that 's always a plus . but , at the end of the day the size of the treats , how few there really are , and the ingredients just make this a very average treat . nothing special here .
 this is the second batch i 've ordered . my dog loves them . great value . great product . nice sized bones for my <unknown> mutt .
 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag . all rinds popped but for the amount of the money that i paid for them i could have gone to the store and bought a $ 2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag . i feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag . i understand that everyone is counting their pennies but i also think that the consumer should get something for their money . i really enjoy this product but i probably will not order any more for this reason .
 sugar . i really enjoyed getting to try this product , and i am actually going on now to start ordering it on a regular basis. < br / > < br / > you can really tell the difference between `` pop '' and juice with sparkling water . it is a bit on the sweet side , and i did not think they needed to add the extra juice flavors to make it just right . however this is a great product , good size for individual servings , and it arrived in good packaging by amazon .
 i love garlic ! we add it to so many dishes so we go through quite a bit of it . for the price and being shipped to our house , this is a great product . i will definitely be buying this again , when we run out ( which i know we will ! ; ) )
 product arrived fast and fresh . the candy was shipped in perfect condition , each piece individually wrapped , soft , chewy , and in good shape . i would not hesitate to order this product again .
 according to the tracking info , the package was delivered but i never received it . i reached out to customer service & they dismissed me and offered no <unknown> , including refusing to contact the <unknown> service to <unknown> a claim . thanks to amazon , i was able to get my money back . however , as a first time customer i would expect some <unknown> and support .
 i love chocolate and have had some of the best . i feel pretty naive to believe i could have gotten anything like that for $ 17 for 2 pounds . these were old and waxy . they were white with age , the dark chocolate that is , and just awful . i took a bite of a couple different kinds and they all were not edible in my opinion . even <unknown> is better than these !
 good flavor , low in calories & fat . good price if shipping & handling are free ... .
 ingredients like california natural , chicken soup for the dog lover 's soul , royal canin , and a couple others that i ca n't remember off the top of my <unknown> < br / > < br / > my mom picked up this newman 's food because it was available at the grocery store . they love the food , but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically . his stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before . this food seems like a real winner for us .
 3/4 '' - 1 '' cubes and smaller that i use for training bits . my last order was completely smaller pieces - making it difficult to use it inside a <unknown> bone as they come out too easily . play time no longer lasts as long. < br / > < br / > i am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix . i would have given it a 5 prior to my last order. < br / > < br / > as a training treat these are amazing .
 <unknown> <unknown> , delicious german <unknown> tastes as good as if it had been made by the hands of your grandmother . the perfect amount of sweetness , dense pastry bread and <unknown> of spice !
 pop chips are delicious , light and tasty . i bought a box of the parmesan garlic and it almost <unknown> before i had a chance to eat some of them .
 i purchased this popcorn because of its low-sodium content ( <unknown> ) . tastes good , pops well & the individual serving size bag is convenient . for my microwave , i find it 's best to take about 15 seconds off the <unknown> popping time for the `` popcorn '' setting .
 great tea ... i have checked other stores ie : target , kohls and they are more than this tea costs plus the boxes you get on amazon are bigger <unknown> .
 i 've tried practically every type of coconut water on the market , and taste nirvana has the best ! it tastes just like the water from a fresh young coconut . i drink about 2 cans a day , so i am glad that amazon can help me keep my fridge stocked . this product is so delicious . my friends noticed that i drink it all the time , and now they 're addicted too ! taste nirvana offers an exceptional product from a company run by wonderful people !
 then wonder where it all went . putting a cup of her food in this thing at dinner time makes her <unknown> ' for it. < br / > it is very tough , and with a dog as <unknown> and <unknown> as mine , it has to be to last . she has n't broken any part of it -- which means it 's <unknown> < br / > i 'm trying to train her to bring it to me when i say , `` where 's your bottle ? '' we 'll see if she <unknown> on .
 low sugar , <unknown> and yummy ... these are a great alternative to some sweeter `` cookies '' . they really have so little sugar , they count as a cracker but my son loves them ! < br / > < br / > < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > barbara 's bakery oatmeal wheat free snackimals animal cookies , <unknown> bags ( pack of 6 ) < /a >
 i ordered this flaxseed after reading how good ground flaxseed was for you . i ordered a grinder , both were reasonably priced , and the grinding was so easily accomplished . i have been using flaxseed daily since that time , and the claims made on the internet have proven to be true . the product arrived on time and in great shape -- i have purchased from this vendor several times , and have not been disappointed .
 much better than having to fight removing coffee grinds from a metal basket . i love being able to just toss grinds into the trash .
 the huge pieces of green onion in it as well . good product and my new favorite flavor. < br / > < br / > huge downside ? <unknown> of sodium per bowl , which is more sodium then you need in day never mind one meal . ouch . the bowl has 2 servings and rounds out at 440 calories . not something you want to eat very often . i really want to buy them again until i read the label . it 's too bad , but it 's not something i 'll eat again .
 my neighbor got us turned on to this . we are using it a lot now . we make soup base out of half chicken broth and half pappy 's seasoning , then add chicken or beef and cut veggies . everyone raves about it , even neighborhood kids . it 's different every time depending on what veggies we use . <unknown> size soup can be made from scratch for just a few dollars . even kids like it . i also use it to flavor steaks and roasts . this seasoning is a well kept secret .
 partners <unknown> are the best crackers you will ever taste . spicy pepper is my favorite . eat these crackers as a snack , or with cheese , hummus , or any other type of dips .
 i purchased this after trying the raspberry jelly and i love both flavors . it is so tasty and uses real fruit and sugar and that is all . this is one of the best jelly 's i have ever had . it is fresh and not over processed , and the color of the jelly is true to the fruit color . thank you amazon for providing top of the line products .
 product is its <unknown> , which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull . it 's as if they infused in <unknown> with as much <unknown> that they could pack in . mind you sugar and artificial coloring are n't the best things for you , but they make for fun times with food . would i recommend you to buy it , sure would . after all what do you have to lose , the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there 's no trip to be made to the store .
 so i really wanted to try this product to avoid consuming calories late at night and was disappointed . the noodles are in a liquid that smells terrible . when you wash the noodles as directed the smell does not go away . i tried everything on the noodles to avoid the smell , hot sauce , tomato sauce , a bunch of spices , and <unknown> nothing worked . i had to force myself to finish eating them because i hate wasting food . the concept is great but they are very <unknown>
 i buy all my loose tea from stash , and <unknown> assam is one of the best assams i 've tasted . it 's a bold , dark red , tea that tastes good any time of day . if you only have a little left in the tin , it blends well with any other black tea .
 i really like this cereal ; it 's better than chex ! it 's less salty and more substantial in texture than chex , and it does n't get soggy in milk . when gluten free cereals were hard to find , i was pleased to find this one . although rice chex is now gluten free , my family prefers rice crunch <unknown> .
 i opened a bag of these and poured them into a bowl . one of the chips on top had something black on it . it looked like black tar or melted black <unknown> . i assumed it was a contaminant of some sort , since it did n't resemble any kind of food ingredient . i wish i had not bought these chips . i am now wary of all kettle products .
 i really enjoy this brand of tea . to put my comment in perspective , i 'm not a coffee drinker and do not care for many teas . so , die hard tea drinker may not appreciate the flavor in this tea that i so like . add a little honey and i could drink this tea for hours . it also makes great ice tea .
 good quality wild rice , few broken pieces , cooks up well , okay price . good mixed with other <unknown> . would order again .
 the lowest price brand and seller . i fully endorse these sardines and this seller as being an excellent example of service and quality goods . i ordered on friday and got them monday morning with free shipping option. < br / > < br / > these are boneless and skinless as specified with very minimal salt added . the fish was fresh even for my ridiculous standards , the olive oil was of good quality with the fish very well marinated , and the oil goes good with cooking or with good french bread and balsamic vinegar .
 i 've used their hemp seed as a substitute for sesame seed in stir fries in < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > simply in season <unknown> edition ( world community cookbook ) < /a > , as well as in the <unknown> wonder bars and <unknown> pasta primavera in < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > vegan fusion world cuisine : extraordinary recipes & <unknown> wisdom from the <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> restaurants < /a > . it 's versatile and has a subtle nutty flavor . they add extra protein . nutritious and delicious !
 sometimes a pop-tart is just what you need , right ? well , we like the frosted brown sugar cinnamon the best , and with the subscribe & save feature from amazon we can have these as backup <unknown> breakfasts in the pantry . very good value , too !
 1/4 pound ( hello ? ) . if you were to eat <unknown> regular size cookies , you 'd end up with the same number of calories but they would n't taste as good as nana 's or be as good for you . but you can always save what you do n't want for later . sometimes i 'll just eat half a cookie and roll up the plastic bag and tape it so i can enjoy the second half later . so far they 've kept just fine for even a couple of weeks . no worries .
 tannic ( leather tongue ) . in the morning i like to use a little too much and steep a little too long because i like a tea that can <unknown> out of the cup by itself . in the afternoon , i use just the right amount and steep for 3-4 minutes in boiling water for a lighter cup . forget the tea blends like english breakfast or overpriced flavored teas ... buy this basic black tea and add your own spices , bergamot or other citrus rinds for a good strong tea with any flavor you enjoy .
 very difficult to open with the aid of some tool , such as scissors , do n't even try without <unknown> < br / > < br / > they are crispy and taste like chips that are n't advertised as being salted . they definitely are n't healthy , because i can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them , and i can see the grease at the bottom of the bag , too. < br / > < br / > they are high-quality chips , and deserve to be put on your table .
 admit , i thought this syrup was great and have used it every <unknown> i tried the da vinci dolce de leche , and it was incredible . never have i tasted anything like it ( i use it primarily for flavoring coffee ) <unknown> off , i have to use a few squirts of the caramel to get flavor , but one small squirt with the da vinci and it was <unknown> syrup here is good , but after trying the da vinci dolce de leche , i now know the difference between good syrup and great syrup .
 discover that the taste did not come anywhere close to that amazing smell i had just got a <unknown> of . i tried equal packets and then later i even tried real sugar with no luck . then i tried stevia powder , < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > 30 grams ( <unknown> oz ) stevia 95 % <unknown> bulk powder < /a > and this was the golden ticket ! if you get this flavor , use stevia as your sweetener . it 's literally the closest thing to actually eating a chocolate glazed donut !
 kind of spice there -- i know because 1 ) it says so on the package and 2 ) i can feel the bite of something on my tongue , but i ca n't place what the spice is and it 's aroma is barely discernible during drinking . it 's like a mouthful of flat , flavorless ... i do n't know what . it was unbearable without sugar , and it did n't improve with it . i did n't add milk because i did n't want to waste milk . take a pass on this one .
 <unknown> to add that , after reviewing a couple of other reviews , it appears that the rollerball is supposed to roll , which was my assumption , but it did not on either of the ones i have used ( bacon and liver flavors ) . i just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball . i was able to on one but not the other . perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling . i 've been using it about a week .
 i 've heard a bunch of great things about chia seeds . i love the texture it adds to juices . i honestly have n't felt much benefit form eating the seeds in terms of strength , endurance , etc but it has helped in cleaning out my system and keeping health on my mind . , but i love the ritual of mixing something healthy and natural in my juices and i love the texture .
 easy to hold bottle , pleasing scent on the shampoo . it lathered very well and rinsed cleanly , paired up with the conditioner , it left my hair feeling very soft and clean . the only bad thing about it , was how it was shipped , in a bubble wrap <unknown> envelope . being shipped like that , caused the bottle to leak a bit , not a lot , but i did have to rinse the bottle off before use . other then that , it 's great .
 my small mixed breed is a picky eater but he seems to like <unknown> so long as i mix it with some good people food . he hasnt had problems digesting it delivery was prompt as expected .
 i love this delicate pink salt . it is by far my favorite type of salt .
 i bought this maple syrup based on the reviews of this product and i am very <unknown> < br / > < br / > in the past i had always purchased grade a maple syrup at the market . i was not even < br / > aware of a grade b . however , i have found the grade b to be very robust and full < br / > flavored on my belgian waffles for breakfast. < br / > < br / > a great way to start the day !
 i 've used the product before and love it but there is just one problem ... . < br / > the order never came and i ordered it a month and half ago . i think i would do better ordering it from some where else . however i gave the product two stars because the product itself is good . it would have been five if i had recieved the product .
 wait to get home to try it ... it did n't disappoint ! very fresh , nicely blended basil flavor ( not too overpowering ) . i am pleased to see it being sold on amazon , as i plan to stock up the next go round. < br / > < br / > enjoy it with some al dente pasta and your favorite vino ... and do n't forget to play some <unknown> music in the background for some <unknown> ! : ) ( it 's also okay to have some <unknown> <unknown> on as well ... )
 will be left with <unknown> % kernals unpopped which is very disappointing. < br / > < br / > the fix for this is to only pop half of the contents ( salt , oil , and kernals ) one time around and then to make a 2nd batch with the remaining half . annoying ? yes . but this will reduce your unpopped kernals from <unknown> % remaining to about 5 % or less. < br / > < br / > this brand taste amazing but i will <unknown> it a star for this small issue .
 great juice . is a great help to health . the road to good health is <unknown> with good intestines .
 up or make my nose run . also enough spice to keep the <unknown> ( my kids ) from wanting more than just a taste. < br / > < br / > the only reason i 'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price . this jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products ... i just ca n't resist the flavor ! haha . so if you do n't like the price , do n't try it . like me , you might not be able to go back to your old jerky .
 it and compared the appearance of the actual bar to the picture on the packaging . however , i was pleasantly surprised by the taste so i decided to buy more. < br / > < br / > they can sometimes leave an impression of being a bit dry or gritty , which i suppose is due to the soy crisps or tapioca starch , or maybe just how dry my own mouth happens to be that day . i simply make sure i have a glass of water available when i plan to eat one of these .
 great item makes giving medicine to my dogs so much easier , they think it 's a treat . a must have for pet owners
 i hated the taste and <unknown> of these cookies . not very good at all . i tried a variety of <unknown> brand sugar free cookies and did not like any of them .
 i recently purchased a dozen bottles from amazon and tell you that : < br / > 1 . amazon service and vendors are the very best. < br / > 2 . the sauce ( which i have used for years ) is <unknown> < br / > 3 . `` city made '' was a pleasure to do business with < br / > 4 . the <unknown> and the sauce are all `` <unknown> ''
 two cans ( i usually <unknown> one can over rice as a quick snack ) . plus this product was processed in <unknown> < br / > < br / > conclusion : i bought 12 cans . definitely will shop for other brands due to the bland flavor of this product . but for the excellent price , i will still give it 3 stars . i would n't say i did n't like it . it is just canned sardines . just pile on your choices of salt , spices , and sauces . then chow away .
 shipping , this is a serious <unknown> < br / > it is worth your while to call around and find it locally ; initially i could not find it locally so i ordered it from amazon . however , several days after ordering it , i found a local store selling it for $ <unknown> per bottle ( i ordered 8 bottles from the local store ) . < br / > < br / > also , it was late arriving ; it was not a <unknown> ' but 3 bottles packed in paper in a box .
 for the value and for the diet this is an amazing snack ! just ordering the mild and another hot . fast shipping with prime and will be a repeat customer ! better than a slim jim and quality is cleaner : )
 canned food and broth , but she 'd lick off the canned food and leave the kibble . i was worried that she was n't getting the nutrients she needed . then i found <unknown> and i am thrilled . she loves it , actually cleans her bowl . i merely drizzle a little warm water on it since i 'm no longer mixing in canned food and she gobbles it up . there are chunks of bananas , peas , carrots , etc . that she seems to love . the mix even contains probiotics . highly recommended .
 them. < br / > < br / > the pieces in the bag vary in size . the most typical is about <unknown> '' long by <unknown> '' wide . there will be some loose crumbs in the bottom too . it looks like they make them in a big pan and then cut them down . i would compare them to bite-size ( or <unknown> sized ) granola bars . it is just the right amount of sweetness added . i love that these have a nice protein boost when i need to grab something and go .
 this is a great coffe maker , for the purpose of making one cup at a time. < br / > the coffee tastes great , i used the gevalia brand . now that i have this <unknown> , i would n't want to be without it . looking forward to trying various types of coffee .
 they 've reformulated their product and the high-fructose corn syrup was replaced with real sugar . i compared several bottles at the store and this one had the most natural ingredients . i 'm no worcestershire sauce expert , but it tastes great to me !
 a freshly made italian soda , but with the convenience of being in a can . it 's not <unknown> like a normal <unknown> pop and it has a lighter fizz ( just the right amount , if you ask me ) . i tried the pomegranate flavor , which i would describe more as a tart <unknown> blend . it has quickly become my beverage of choice when i open up the fridge . it 's definitely more of a sparkling fruit juice than what you would think of as `` pop '' . i highly recommend it !
 the taco bell chipotle sauce is very bold and flavorful ! i tried it with chicken wings , tacos , and a salad , and it made each dish extremely tasty . i am so glad i sampled this new sauce . it will be a staple condiment .
 several different sellers on multiple occasions and i have consistently received expired products . additionally , some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you ca n't tell when the product expires . beware of the following sellers as i have had trouble with each of them : toys samurai , <unknown> and <unknown> . i have reported each of them to amazon ( 4 different complaints in the past 4 months ) and amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates . good luck .
 ordered on feb first -- today is <unknown> still no order -- - told out of stock - but as when i ordered - amazon says it 's in <unknown> so order but dont look for your order for 30 - 40 days ( cant say dont have them yet )
 we had never tried red chips before and was n't sure what we would be getting , we were pleasantly surprised . they have a great flavor and texture .
 almond . for a cookie that is rather large like this one , i would increase the nuts and chocolate by at least 50 % , but preferably a whole lot more. < br / > < br / > in all honestly , six large cookies in each box makes this a rather impractical packaging for our family of five . but , the cookies are good , so they will definitely go on our list for times when we are out and about and ca n't just whip up a batch of homemade chocolate chunk oatmeal cookies .
 i bought this flour just shortly after buying my first bread machine . it is so nice to have this <unknown> mixture , and not have to `` dilute '' it with regular flour . the recipe on the outside of the bag makes the most delicious loaf of bread we have made so far with our new machine ! < br / > you can also <unknown> this flour for whole wheat flour on any bread recipe ... very nice !
 i work at the public <unknown> and we have family movie programs on a regular basis . there could be anywhere from 10 to 60 people watching the movie and i need to have the popcorn ready at a steady pace . we have one of the big popcorn machines on a cart and use great northern popcorn 's 8 ounce packs . the popcorn tastes great and the packaging is perfect for our needs .
 i absolutely love these ! we have very few vegetarian products in this small town so it was great to find these . now if only they were not so expensive !
 i am wheat , gluten , and dairy-free and generally avoid packaged and processed foods , but there are a number of tasty , safe , gluten-free products out there . this is not one of them . i <unknown> these cookies . the texture is awful . dry . like eating a cake made of sand . save yourself and eat a piece of fruit instead .
 my toddler gobbles these up and asks for more ! even the ones that are green bean , peas , pear , and salba . it 's like a miracle ! my baby eats them too , but not with quite as much enthusiasm . it makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and i do n't need to break my neck trying to do it . oh and they are wonderfully <unknown> . i shove a few in my purse when i know we will be out during hungry times .
 and there were peanuts with a little bit of m & m stuck to them and then a lot of m & m dust . the snickers were not squished and the <unknown> sticks were all intact , so not sure what <unknown> < br / > < br / > that being said , these deals that amazon are fantastic and they pack them very well . definitely worth it if you need to buy it in bulk . just , with all bagged candies , be forewarned that all the pieces may not come in totally intact .
 nuts . i know they only have them in hawaii and i was shipping them to my son 's girlfriend who had them there and was telling us about how good they were . unfortunately , when they shipped they came in all melted . i would have thought the company would have sent them with dry ice or <unknown> them . we could not even try them because the tin foil wrapper melted into the chocolate . we had to return the product . my suggestion since the bag was $ <unknown> they should invest in dry ice .
 the <unknown> flour was securely packaged . service was fast . i made <unknown> flat bread yesterday ; quality <unknown> < br / > < br / > i assume that most people who order this flour already know how to make <unknown> . but having the recipe on the package would be very convenient . i had not had <unknown> flour for some time and had to refer to my cookbook for the recipe . i was thrilled to find a source for the flour . jane <unknown> .
 are not the <unknown> imported cashews that normally sell for $ 15 a pound . the description of this product says <unknown> cashews ' , in fact only about 75 % are whole the remainder are halves and pieces . for snacking or cooking they 're great . not too salty ( sea salt ) . well worth the price , especially if you order on the subscription plan . i do n't think you can find a better product at a lower price . these are factory sealed containers from <unknown> 's ' , not <unknown> from bulk .
 which is a big plus . others have commented about a fishy smell when they first opened the bag , which they found objectionable . i have a tiny kitchen , and though i noticed the smell , i prepared them according to instructions & i had no problem . i rinsed them really well , then boiled for several minutes , then put in a saute pan and added spices to taste . the noodles are tasteless and pick up the flavor of whatever prepared with , so it is a perfect <unknown> carb option . highly recommended !
 how delish it was ! i was so impressed that i found our hostess and commented on how much i enjoyed the scones and fruit spread . to my surprise , she told me it was st. dalfour and i was very surprised that it was n't home made , it was that good ! it 's a little on the pricey side , but please believe me when i tell you , it is worth every penny . i also love that it has no added sugar . this is truly a quality product at it 's finest !
 my wife is a coffee <unknown> and she loves dunkin donuts coffee and she feels folgers black silk is a very very close second ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
 easy , tasty mint tea brew . for months i used k cup just for one over sized mint tea cup , but <unknown> used it again and found that the weaker 2nd cup was very tasty ! so i recommend getting the best value and use it 2x for yourself and it becomes twice as good . well worth the price for the convenience and taste . : )
 my pork chops the hard way with flour , egg , and <unknown> . shake n bake for pork was much easier . just wash your chops and stick them in the bag and shake ! i do n't have to clean up flour and <unknown> all over my counter anymore . the taste of the seasoning was not over powering and it makes for an easy and fast dinner . obviously this is not as good as home made but if you are looking to make a quick dinner for the family this definitely works in a pinch .
 i 've had their sauces before , which i 'd highly recommend , and their <unknown> did n't disappoint ! great flavors on anything you 're cooking .
 , and they are addicted to dry food . i still feed them fancy feast canned food ( it 's the only wet food they will eat ) and i am happy that i found a good quality dry food that they will eat ! i 've offered 4 different premium quality dry foods side by side , and the cats prefer this one ! they wo n't touch most healthy foods , so wellness must have a palatable formula . i recommend this food to anyone with a cat who insists on eating dry food and is finicky !
 one of the best deals i have seen for rose preserves . great price for the quality and quantity you receive . will purchase this again .
 constantly go over the eyes or <unknown> to make it darker ( had to do that with the wilton brand ) . i used one pen and it seemed like it did n't want to work after the first few cake pops . no worries , just popped the second one open and from then on it was smooth <unknown> . i did have to use a napkin to <unknown> it a couple of times in between cake pops . i love these pens and i 'm glad i ordered it ! i would definitely buy these again ! !
 these are so good , especially when they are still hot . i love the way they still <unknown> and pop while eating . sometimes i sprinkle some hot sauce on mine straight from the microwave or a little parmesan cheese , depending on my mood . however i eat them , they are really good . remember to shake them well for a minute or two before nuking them . the bags do not puff up as much as microwave popcorn , so do n't expect them to . only cook for the suggested time on the bag .
 it 's got good flavor , bold but not strong . very pleasing and enjoyable tea . if you like plum flavor and alittle cinnamon then this is for you .
 of all the brands of earl grey , stash is my favorite . the double bergamot is the best . the flavor is fantastic . i have in the past had a difficult time finding it in any of the <unknown> stores i shop at , and when i do the price is at least a dollar a box more than here. < br / > < br / > if you like a flavorful tea , you should like this one . in my <unknown> you ca n't go wrong with this one .
 i bought this along with < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > <unknown> organic <unknown> crisp cereal , <unknown> boxes ( pack of 6 ) < /a > and < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > <unknown> organic peanut butter panda puffs cereal , <unknown> boxes ( pack of 6 ) < /a > gorilla munch is powerful , but none can <unknown> the <unknown> . our jimmies are <unknown> .
 these were nice and sweet . they grew pretty quick with little effort on my part . i highly recommend them to anyone from beginner to advanced .
 sprouts carries these at their <unknown> and when i found out i could buy a box vs one at a time , i was in . these are like fig newtons , but so much better and gluten free !
 we have purchased this treat for our dogs for many <unknown> , from our vet , and now online . they are digestible , good for their teeth , and our dogs love them . they will do any trick for their `` <unknown> '' , and it keeps them happy for a while . we get the large size and have 2 big <unknown> and 100 lbs .
 i actually ordered these by accident thinking i was getting the original <unknown> chef naan . while these were okay , i really prefer the original naan . i still gave these four stars because for those that really like garlic , these are great and make a really good pizza base . however , the original continues to be king in my book !
 minerals . the price may seem high compared to table salt , but amazon 's price is low compared to other places i 've bought it . definitely worth it , in my opinion. < br / > < br / > one thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist , so it does n't work well in a grinder or shaker . sometimes i 'll serve it in a salt <unknown> , but generally i just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table .
 fenugreek is a great supplement for all breastfeeding moms . it has increased my milk supply extensively . i recommend it for all moms .
 peanut butter dark chocolate bar : bar advertised as peanut butter and dark choco - so i was surprised to find almonds in it . tastes good but very hard ... almost seemed old but was n't based on expiration date on package. < br / > < br / > dark choco cherry cashew bar : awesome and chewy .
 yet tried the other two flavors . will update as i do. < br / > < br / > if you have n't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes . less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat. < br / > < br / > so far i have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active . these definitely beat a 150 - 300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack .
 bitter tasting <unknown> came with the hemp bag as a sample and i 'm definately not buying <unknown> company should stop sending these as a sample .
 of a typical kibble texture and a nice size for a treat for a dog up to about 50 pounds . the softer , squishy `` meaty '' looking pieces are of <unknown> size . most are larger than the hard kibbles . some are quite small -- there will be a very small portion of the bag that ends up as topping for a meal . nutritionally and <unknown> , it is not as good as the <unknown> i use as my dogs ' main diet . so i do recommend this for use as a training treat !
 jasmine in the bag it really gets lost in brewing so that this really just tastes more like a good green tea . if that 's what you 're after i 'd recommend this tea , but if you 're after a more jasmine fragrance and flavor experience i find this one a little weak . the <unknown> jasmine i used to order ( now i guess listed as an oolong by them ) was much more to my liking , but it also was a bit overpowering to some so like everything it comes down to personal taste .
 decent flavor , but a very unfortunate texture . it seems more like a hardened <unknown> liquid than jerky . i 'll finish the container , eventually , but will definitely not be buying more .
 my dog absolutely loves these . i do n't have to feel guilty giving her one because they are low in calories . i would buy these again .
 to other folks that prefer gourmet spicy ... i agree that is a classic but enjoyed these more : very good broth especially , less heat but more rich flavor than gourmet spicy . the lack of <unknown> <unknown> of freeze dried beef does n't bother me , i 'll garnish mine with whatever i have in the fridge . i 'm disappointed amazon has raised the price somewhat , a case was about $ 10 cheaper in december . if you 're hesitant , try a single pack at your local korean grocer before you get a case .
 soup seems too hard , all you have to do is switch your electric kettle to on , dump the packet into a cup and you 're good to go . maybe a cup of apple cider a day can even keep the doctor away , who knows ? < br / > < br / > overall , i recommend the <unknown> spiced cider drink mixes as a quick and easy way to enjoy a hot beverage . it wo n't be as authentic as homemade cider , but it wo n't be a hassle to prepare either .
 my mother-in-law gave me a couple of these to share with my boston <unknown> and my older bichon . they gobble them up . they 're chewy and satisfying , and best of all , made with real salmon , so the <unknown> 's are included . i highly recommend .
 after reading several reviews from people apparently on diets i now understand the high star rating because if you ca n't have the real thing something like this passes for good . these are bland , have a weird texture and are n't very good . i will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away . i ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry . they are low in calories and low in taste . pass .
 its hard to describe taste especially since i 'm not a connoisseur of chocolate but of the brands that i have tasted , this one sits in the middle for me , not of the highest taste pleasure sensation but a great deal better then others i 've tried . i love the newman 's own brand and every product i 've tried from this brand has been excellent . i think this one might be best used for baking rather than eating straight out of the package .
 next time . the sauce comes in a pack of 2 , but one bottle was broken . yep , you guessed it , amazon sent me a new pack of two , and asked me to return the unbroken original . it 's only cost me a little time , but how much it 's going to cost amazon to ship and process that returned bottle , your guess is as good as mine . is it really beyond the <unknown> of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle ?
 i bought this for my mother who is allergic to milk . she loves it . she said it mixes well in both cold and hot water ( unlike supermarket powdered milk which does n't mix well in cold water ) . she said the taste is great and she enjoys it on cereal , in her coffee and for cooking . highly recommend this !
 we were very surprised that this stuff existed , but have used it in lots of places . it 's great to add to soda or in your cooking . 100 % recommend it .
 i sampled this product and was not impressed . it took me several <unknown> to make it through this can . it 's metallic , bitter and not a pleasant caffeine beverage . although not a coffee connoisseur , i suspect one would better appreciate the bold bite this beverage delivers . i 'm not sure if this was the only coffee available i 'd choose it again . there are better tasting options available and also at better <unknown> .
 i prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven . they are the perfect compliment to a hamburger , steak or chicken entree . try them . you 'll like them !
 my 8 month son loves these but off late i am making home made purees ( inspired by `` super baby food '' book ) < br / > however these are very handy and convenient for travel purposes
 this tastes just like the iced tea you buy at starbucks . i like it better because i make it with purified , filtered water . great tea
 ive never tried <unknown> <unknown> so i didnt know what it was going to taste like . when i finally got it i took one bite and <unknown> not the greatest taste ... ... .not like any <unknown> ive tasted . jack links should take this beef steak off the market ... ... .maybe ok for older people that cant tolerate hot food ... <unknown> older friend really liked it so i gave it to him . try the peppered beef steak by jack links its the best by far .
 there is nothing better than a delicious metromint on a hot summer day . i would take a bottle of <unknown> with me to work everyday during the summer and it would keep me cool and fresh all day . i personally love all of the flavors of <unknown> but my favorites are peppermint , <unknown> and <unknown> . i would recommend <unknown> to everyone and have already gotten many friends and family to start drinking it . a+ material here .
 i love spicy and this bbq sauce is definitely spicy . i cant believe its zero yup zero calories . its mind blowing . we all pour on the sauces and the calories add up quickly but not with walden farms . i love them .
 came to me with a chipped lid . i wrote an email to the company to see what i could do and no one responded .
 this was a very good product ! i loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone ! ! i plan on ordering more when i can .
 vita coco tastes almost like <unknown> coconuts from tree and drinking fresh . if you have never experienced coconut water before , certainly drink it very <unknown> < br / > i found this <unknown> resealable package to be ideal for my family ( my husband and daughters are addicted to vita coco ) . 34 oz feeds them for 2 days ( if that ) and is less waste than having to throw out several of the smaller 11 oz sizes. < br / > next purchase will be the 17oz size .
 the greenies ordered through amazon is less expensive than the `` <unknown> & mortar '' stores ; and i plan to order another box . we received the product a few days after placing the order. < br / > < br / > terrific product , and our lab loves this treat !
 found these for a great <unknown> the box with a friend and we both loved them .
 is that it is decidedly on the mild side ; although the bag specified `` medium roast , '' it was much milder and smoother than i was used to tasting with a medium roast blend . but that 's okay , as i much prefer a milder coffee to anything with bitter overtones , which i often find in other brands of coffee labeled medium or <unknown> < br / > < br / > to cap things off , the melitta coffee is noticeably cheaper than starbucks . hmmm ... . i may just switch coffee <unknown> .
 < br / > < br / > the concept is a good one . if this cookie had been done with cranberry or something <unknown> than fig in small doses it probably would have <unknown> better . likewise doing a fig cookie more like the <unknown> cookies would also have been a good concept <unknown> . instead , the newton thin tries to be a cookie and a newton and it ca n't be both ; which i guess is why the old <unknown> was , `` it 's not a cookie ... it 's a newton '' .
 i love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them . these are the only chips i eat
 i discovered 3 years ago when i needed to eat more foods with a better glycemic response . these are great and really keep me satisfied . i 'm on the auto delivery plan which is so much cheaper than the grocery store . i used to try to wait until they went on sale at the grocery store , but now i just do the amazon auto delivery and cheap price . i do wish they would make them a little healthier and stop with the palm kernel oil and a little less sugar would suit me better .
 i love this conditioner . it does n't just prevent dry scalp but really made my hair soft which is nice because i blow dry and <unknown> it every morning and my hair can get dry . but this <unknown> nicely without making it greasy . i definitely recommend it .
 <unknown> ! am i glad i found these senseo paris french vanilla caramel bistro coffee pods ! all of my local stores either do not carry them anymore or are charging over $ 5 for one 16-count bag . the 6 bag pack should easily cover the 3 month subscription time frame as i only use one pod a day . the other great thing is that the package 's expiration date is many months in the future so i know they are fresh ! i highly recommend subscribing to the automatic re-order system . thank you amazon.com !
 a very good value , for the whole family ! 1 package , instead of 5 2 lb bags . great for all kitchen sweetening , from cakes to candies or just a large supply for beverages , from coffee and tea to a myriad of cold beverages . a must have , at a good price. < a href= '' http : <unknown> '' > <unknown> sugar - 10 lb . bag < /a >
 drink it ) or cold , the crystals dissolve instantly , <unknown> only a slight hint at what lies in store at the first sip . the ginger will strike the back of your throat and make itself known , overwhelming any hint of lemon in the drink . the strength of ginger is not something that most people are <unknown> about , you either enjoy it or not . if this is to your taste you will like this tea as you long as you adjust the relative strength by adding more or less water to the mix .
 i ordered this popcorn to use with the popcorn marker i got for christmas . very good popcorn , i was n't sure about the coconut oil taste at first but it 's a very mild coconut flavor that one can barely taste . i ordered the 2.5 oz size and it makes enough for 2 people to share . i 'll order again !
 gevalia <unknown> is one of my favorite coffee companies . i adore the light , slightly sweet taste of this french vanilla coffee above all others. < br / > most of the coffee you find at the grocery store starts out palatable and then ends on a bitter note . it <unknown> the whole cup of <unknown> < br / > this is n't the case with any of gevalia 's coffee 's that i 've had to date . i 'm so glad we could find it here on amazon ! i highly recommend this coffee .
 i also purchased this potting soil and <unknown> all the plants in my home . now i have gnats everywhere . i thought this was the best potting soil and paid more for it only to end up with gnats . hundreds of them . i wish i had read the previous post before . do not buy this product . now it will cost me double to buy another brand and the work of repotting about 40 plants .
 it seems they only carry the smaller size jars in stores . it 's so easy to order the <unknown> ounce size via amazon and i do n't have to worry if the store has it in stock or not . simply smooth tastes like good `` hotel '' coffee ( remember when people use to actually <unknown> coffee in big <unknown> ) but does n't have a bitter or acidic effect like most other coffee . i 'd change the name though because simply smooth sounds like a laxative versus a coffee with smooth taste . simply tasty ?
 i use this olive oil all the time and am very happy with it for everyday cooking needs . paid $ <unknown> today at costco .
 i 'm not a big fan on package potatoes but my kids love them so i thought i would give them a try i have to say that they are pretty good will be buying more shipping was fast .
 i love these chopped walnuts . i put them in cereal , chicken salad and sweet potato casserole , to name a few . they are good for you , also .
 / > the quality of espresso seems pretty good . it 's dark , full-bodied and flavorful . i personally prefer some milk , cream or <unknown> in my drink , but that boils down to personal preference. < br / > < br / > would i buy it again ? probably not , but again it 's a personal preference thing . i do prefer some of their <unknown> drinks a lot more. < br / > < br / > but if this is what you 're looking for , i suppose it 's perfectly fine .
 > but the reason i 'm giving it one star is that grinding six tablespoons of this left our <unknown> burr grinder reeking of vanilla . that has n't happened with other vanilla-flavored coffees we 've tried . running <unknown> beans through did n't cure it , nor did <unknown> and cleaning it . the vanilla seems to have permeated some <unknown> parts that ca n't be cleaned , and it 's flavoring other coffee we run through it , so we 're buying a new grinder . that was a very expensive pot of coffee . : - (
 some ) . < br / > < br / > after that ordered from amazon and it had neither chocolate nor even coffee flavor . looked and tasted as if they dried already used once coffee and packed it again . even color looked like a very weak tea . checked all 24 , one was a bit better but not even remotely close to the 1st pack. < br / > < br / > if you are willing to take chances , get it from a local retailer so that you can return a bad batch .
 i decided to be creative with my thanksgiving turkey this year by using <unknown> duck fat instead of butter . i was so glad to find this at such a great price ! i ordered 2 jars with standard delivery and it was at my door 2 days later ! i blended fresh herbs with the fat and worked it under the skin . wow ! this really elevated the taste and gave it a nice crispy skin . the breast meat was so moist and tender -- almost <unknown> . i ca n't wait to use this again .
 i love this <unknown> it was recomended to me by my dr. to help during <unknown> does n't taste too bad with some honey , and makes me feel more relaxed .
 i ate them all . there were only 6 of them . i mixed 1/2 cup of milk into the dry mix and slowly mixed it together . i poured the mix into my sprayed cast iron 6 cup muffin pan . i cooked them in my small <unknown> oven and they cooked up nicely . they were moist on the inside . the mixes were very fresh smelling and had a freshness date well into <unknown> the pouch is a nice tough plastic one and will keep the mix fresh . it is very easy to open also .
 love this herbal tea ! it 's so delicious ! it tastes just like oolong tea from the chinese restaurant minus the unhealthy tannins found in actual tea !
 any dog puppy to senior and any breed dog loves these treats . they go crazy over them ! ! ! they are healthy too . i have been buying them for a few years now . how i first found out about them is i read an article online about the oldest dog to live ate these treats . so that made me want to buy them for the health of them . so i do feel good about feeding healthy treats that dogs really like the taste of ! ! !
 version of <unknown> ( <unknown> , a <unknown> <unknown> , and & <unknown> ; <unknown> & <unknown> ; is & <unknown> ; child of & <unknown> ; or of & <unknown> ; derived from & <unknown> ; . ) <unknown> are used for <unknown> , <unknown> or cutlets served on rice or in soups . the cutlets , <unknown> chicken or pork , are coated with these light and crispy crumbs and fried . they are not gritty and dense like regular crumbs . they are very nice on deep fried shrimps and decorative for a more gourmet touch .
 or are feeling tired . i have tried several energy drinks in the past , and this one is a good option . it is highly carbonated , and it tasted a little strong to me , but it was not unpleasant by any means . i do n't think that it gave a better boost than any other drink , and i do n't think that it is the best tasting , but it does work . so for that i do give it four stars . if you can get it cheap it is worth a try .
 's <unknown> wisconsin cheddar microwavable mac & cheese , <unknown> boxes ( pack of 6 ) , saved my family . my husband was beginning to get <unknown> from having to actually go over to flow 's food for his annie 's <unknown> wisconsin cheddar microwavable mac & cheese , <unknown> boxes ( pack of 6 ) , then we saw it on amazon.com , and we 've been happily <unknown> for five hours. < br / > < br / > so in conclusion , buy this item immediately , who needs a life when you have amazon.com ?
 i purchased this to send as a gift and the recipient loved it . taste was up to par with their palate and it was delivered in a timely manner . will make future purchases with omaha steaks .
 , i do n't know why it is even on the label . i do n't hate it , but will find trouble trying to finish the 48 cups i bought . i think anyone who buys this must have tasted rooibos tea before . i love the organic part of this drink . i did not find this tea weak , the flavor is just bland , except for the slight <unknown> aroma , and an earthy taste . it is unique alright , but not like a tea to me . maybe it takes getting used to .
 hard to find out the snack was made in china . i do n't have a problem with the snack 's origin , but mrs. <unknown> should be more <unknown> with their customers and let them make the decision themselves . granted , most of us americans are primed to flip out at the latest scare of the week , but that should be our choice to make. < br / > < br / > oh , and the snack itself ? it is quite tasty , filling , and healthy . i will continue to purchase it .
 this oil is delicious on salad or cooked . i prefer to use on the salad because you can really taste the basil flavor and it is outstanding . gives that extra oomph and kick to the taste .
 this was a very weak tasting product . it was a watered down hot chocolate at best . i was hoping that it would be an organo gold product that i would enjoy . i will not purchase it again .
 thank you for the chocolate covered pomegranate seeds . not only are they delicious , but they are the real thing ( containing only pomegranate seeds ) . delivery was exactly as mentioned .
 , and add real complexity to soups , stews or anyplace you would use fresh mushrooms. < br / > < br / > dried mushrooms do n't weigh much , so you will find your order may be larger than you expect . the supplier recommends that you store them in the refrigerator or <unknown> < br / > < br / > shipping was amazing . i ordered them on friday and received them on monday , standard shipping -- the package started in massachusetts and arrived in seattle in four days ! very happy with that !
 it is the perfect size portion pack for my new popcorn popper. < br / > tastes just like movie theater popcorn . i would recommend this < br / > anyone that likes popcorn .
 the cereal to `` talk '' to you . you 'll be hearing the snap , crackle pop of your <unknown> < br / > < br / > an extra bonus is this cereal tastes chocolatey good while providing some healthy nutrition . use low-fat milk to stay healthy or go decadent and enjoy your bowl of cereal with a bit of half-and-half . when using half-and-half the cereal will almost taste like milk chocolate. < br / > < br / > yum ! yum ! good ! < br / > < br / > recommend .
 the tea very weak ( i need to use three bags to obtain the flavor of one traditional tea bag ) , it has a slightly `` off '' taste as well. < br / > it is also a good product in that you can toss a bag into your water bottle before you leave home and have tea for the road with no <unknown> < br / > it is n't undrinkable , and we 're finishing off our boxes slowly but surely ; but my entire family would much rather drink traditionally brewed stash peach tea .
 a decent , clean , and simple cup of morning decaf . i find <unknown> the pod helps extract a little extra flavor .
 of anything else going on , and maybe that is what some people consider strong . maxwell house crowd perhaps . i prefer coffee with more depth and complexity , i.e . starbucks , and jet fuel misses that mark by a wide <unknown> < br / > < br / > my favorite k cups so far have been donut shop , kona , and caribou blend . caribou is a great choice if you like bold and rich coffee , but now i am stuck with 50 cups of jet fuel . do n't believe the hype .
 what 's better than skippy super chunk ? < br / > < br / > 10 pounds of skippy super chunk for <unknown> ! ! ! < br / > < br / > need i <unknown> ?
 this are the seeds to buy . warning : once you go bigs , you can not go back to david 's sunflower seeds ! < br / > < br / > i 've given up waiting for supplies to sell on amazon and went directly to their web site : [ ... ] . < br / > one good item you can order mix and match seeds in one order <unknown> buying a case of one specific product here .
 these better than the temptations treats she had before , and i am convinced that these are somewhat <unknown> < br / > < br / > the pouch recommends 12 treats a day , all at once , or even more for my <unknown> cat . i usually do more like 5-6 , because that many treats seems excessive ( she would love it though ) . either way , she has n't had any hairballs since . i am not positive about the causal relationship , but i suspect these did the trick . they 're great !
 . i stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks , until i want to give it to my dog . freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the kong if it was n't <unknown> < br / > < br / > she is <unknown> of <unknown> , and will keep us up with <unknown> , barking , howling and <unknown> if not distracted . this stuff will distract her from anything . then i can sleep ... <unknown> ... ... ...
 this is a fantastic flavored tea . we are addicted to it . we add a little vanilla soy milk and it 's like having desert . just wonderful . highly recommend this tea ! ! ! ! ! ! !
 this is the best gluten free pasta i 've found in the past 3 years ! it stays firm even when reheating . my husband even loves it ! it costs more than other gluten free pastas i 've tried , but it 's definitely worth it ! try it - you wo n't regret it !
 our two <unknown> year dogs like these . they 're prone to major tartar build up on their teeth and these helped some and made their breath better . i never expected these to polish the teeth perfectly but they made a bad condition not so bad .
 i was glad to know that amazon has this product in their groceries <unknown> < br / > though the shipping was individually priced , do n't know whether there was any option to pack the glass <unknown> < br / > anyway , i liked the fast service .
 lower in calories and great taste . i like them just as much as the regular greasy chips . it 's nice to have a great tasting healthy alternative .
 the blend of ingredients is great and a good balance of dried fruit and nuts that our family enjoys . i was having trouble finding it in the local stores that i shop so i thought i would shop for this online . i was happy to find it but unhappy about how much more it costs to order online than picking it up at a local store . i do n't think i will order it again online and will simply keep my eyes open when i shop locally .
 br / > < br / > the distributor i got this tea from claims the teabags can be used 2 or more times , but i found that getting even one cup of decent tea out of the teabag was a <unknown> < br / > < br / > if you 're looking for a healthy , but boring `` tea '' , this is definitely the tea for you ! < br / > < br / > if you 're looking for a healthy and fuller tasting tea , i would pass this one up .
 it is hard to find a good vegan smoked salt . the smoke scent was not that strong when i first opened it . now ; the scent is stronger , but the taste is still minimal . it is easy to make your food too salty , hoping to make the smoke taste stronger . it does the trick , but do n't expect a strong flavor .
 we like these almonds and were unable to get them at our local store anymore so found them on amazon and ordered them .
 low list of ingredients has some other positives that come with it too . there are 0 calories and 0 sugars in this drink . which is incredible . and there 's even some b vitamins thrown in too. < br / > < br / > so while the dye makes it a tad less than healthy , this is still a pretty good soda substitute . it 's healthy , still has the fizz , and tastes good . i definitely will keep buying it. < br / > < br / > review by m. reynard 2012
 . we are so happy ! he 's also a picky eater , but he loves the canidae and never turns his nose up at it. < br / > < br / > a couple of notes for any <unknown> readers : we <unknown> out <unknown> and protein sensitivities early on . he 's on <unknown> and <unknown> for the ibd , and most likely will be for life . the vet said that no matter what we do , he will likely be subject to bouts of <unknown> . that 's why the canidae seems so miraculous .
 was told by a friend to try nettle tea for allergies . brought it & it works great & quickly . long time allergy suffer who loves nettle tea . i 'm able to use it & stopped all the other medications ... .
 good . i was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good . the original flavor reminds me a lot of the munchos chips . the original flavor and salt/vinegar are my favorite but they are all good . my least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor ( i do n't like cheddar ) but most people really like it . i have purchased these several times now and i will continue to do so . i highly recommend this product for anyone !
 a friend introduced me to <unknown> tea biscuits several months ago . <unknown> to find them in my local grocery stores i discovered them on amazon at a most reasonable price . they are sugar free but still very tasty . it 's easy to sit down with two cups of hot green tea and consume a complete package of these treats . they are irresistible without doubt and make a super snack . just do n't <unknown> .
 i absolutely love these nuts ! i ca n't find them where i live so i will continue to order these from amazon . they are well worth the price .
 as an energy drink junkie , i find myself hopping from energy drink to energy drink looking for something to keep me going at a low cost and good taste . with <unknown> and it 's variety of flavors i can mix it up so i do n't get bored with the same taste and purchasing by the case makes it cost effective . i am a fan of the sugar free <unknown> even though the <unknown> is freaking delicious . hands down <unknown> has the best tasting energy drinks on the market .
 tried other brands , <unknown> , and <unknown> . highland sugarworks is by far the favorite . we always go back to this one . perfect on pancakes and waffles , oatmeal , add to a smoothie , drizzle on ice cream . with amazon 's autoship , the price is reasonable . it 's delicious . ( the kids still prefer the yucky table syrup with artificial everything . oh , well . we are no longer buying that junk so they 'll eventually appreciate the good stuff . tip : never start with the yucky stuff . )
 i love quaker products . this bar taste amazing . it actually taste like banana nut bread , which i love . a lot of snack bars do n't have a lot of flavor but this has so much flavor . the banana is n't too overbearing and the nuts give it a great texture . it 's great on the go .
 gummy spectrum , <unknown> : softer than then those two layer gummy <unknown> ( which i also enjoy ) . i 'd describe the taste , but i ca n't place it myself . the most specific i can be is to say they have a light fruity <unknown> < br / > < br / > a fun surprise is that these ones are quite a bit larger than those found in retail stores . i 'd estimate the normal ones between one and two inches , but these are a full three and half inches in length .
 not at all like coke or pepsi ... ... <unknown> sweet and too acidic at the same time , ... ... ... ... ... and little flavor. < br / > < br / > store brand cola is better .
 tea , first off . i do n't have too much experience with <unknown> , but i do like the flavor of this . however , i do n't taste too much of the mandarin . it almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea , and it has a similar light <unknown> color . i drink it with a little honey. < br / > < br / > all in all , it 's a decent tea . i do n't think i 'll order it again , but i 'll certainly finish off this tin .
 but the reason i can not give 5 stars is three times now i have had a brewing problem that i have not had with other brands . two times , the coffee went all over the brewing part and not a straight shot into the cup . today , i noticed several grains in my cup , so <unknown> than waste a cup , i <unknown> it through a filter and enjoyed my cup . i have bought tully 's before , but <unknown> from this seller . wonder why the problems so many of us are <unknown> ?
 ] . liked it so well that the <unknown> search took me to amazon . the product was available at a very reasonable price and no <unknown> charge for a case . ordered two 48 package cases which arrived quickly and in excellent shape . we follow a <unknown> hot & sour soup technique of adding a well stirred egg slowly in to the soup [ stir in one direction ] about two minutes before it 's finished . you 'll soon ask the question - where did all those noodles come from ? ha ! enjoy a treat ...
 now i know that `` stuff '' is moving through her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating <unknown> < br / > < br / > the same for <unknown> <unknown> kitty -- she , who is <unknown> and small ( <unknown> weighs twice as much as <unknown> <unknown> and is twice as long as <unknown> <unknown> ) , also pops out some big ones now . i am happy -- yes i am -- this means their intestinal transit time ( from eating to pooping ) is shorter and they are healthier for it .
 them also so they do n't stay around our house long. < br / > < br / > this was my first grocery purchase from amazon and i was n't sure what to expect . they arrived in factory carton packed in another box for protection . they had a full year before `` best by '' date and me and my kids noticed right away that they were much tastier than ones we have bought from the grocery store . i think they were fresher than ones that went through warehouses on their way to the store .
 the natural ingredients , nutritional value , and that yummy chummies are actually from alaska are very important to us , but it 's the fact that our dogs love them that keeps us coming back . we just need something bigger than a <unknown> bag .
 , but for some reason this did n't excite her as much as <unknown> < br / > i 'm getting a new kitty soon , and i 'll update it when i try to give new kitty this food. < br / > edit : new kitty likes it fine . this is n't her favorite choice . she likes tuna , chicken , and beef all better than this . unlike the other cat , she likes this more than dry food - about as much as she likes the iams wet food i also feed her .
 i know i can make the same thing at home in my blender . however , my kids wo n't eat it because it 's not in a cool squeeze container like the happy baby blends . they are the best ! both my children love them and i am happy to let them grab them off the shelf at anytime . the nutritional value is hard to beat . the quality is excellent .
 fresh and easy neighborhood market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and i enjoy trying them . one is a variety of <unknown> soups from canada . today , i had the butternut squash and red pepper soup . quite good . smooth and mellow . mild taste , but delicious . goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving ( 2 servings per can ) . alas , the sodium content is a bit higher than i like . otherwise , very good. < br / > < br / > gary peterson
 in date , and both of us ( hubby and self ) got an upset stomach from eating it , like you do at the movies if you add their `` butter '' . i would return this if i could i 've had it since july , and just opened the pack last night ) and would not recommend it , at least not for the big home popcorn machines . and , has a higher calorie count and fat count than the <unknown> , too ! ( sort of explains the upset stomach , i guess ! )
 i ordered the tassimo coffee maker and coffee discs for my daughter . i received the coffee in a timely manner , but i have yet to recieve the coffee maker ... .very dissapointed with this service ... .
 really help. < br / > as for the calories , i see a lot of people commenting on this . as a <unknown> i am required to keep my weight down and so i know a thing or two about calories but these are not that high in calories if eaten as a meal replacement or a high energy snack in the afternoon . remember these are made with a lot of nuts which are full of good fat , protein , and low on the glycemic index . cherry and lemon are my favorite flavors . yum !
 pieces to it . tastes the same if not better then this. < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > no <unknown> < br / > quality ingredients. < br / > chocolate is n't super sweet ( which i think is a pro , some might see it as a con ) . < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > price. < br / > is pretty generic tasting , nothing <unknown> < br / > high in calories , but what granola is n't ?
 my mom likes a cloud of milk in hers . sweeteners are not needed as it is so round in mouth. < br / > < br / > to my knowledge , <unknown> is the most popular of <unknown> teas . you can also pick it up from dean and deluca to avoid shipping or directly from the <unknown> website ( where shipping is unfortunately expensive but the choices are ) . < br / > < br / > try this beautiful tea blend ; it is a real luxurious treat ! < br / > cheers !
 i have to say , it 's spendy for just a soda pop , but considering it 's japanese and such ... i guess you ca n't go wrong . especially when they taste so good ! this was my first one ever , since they are n't sold anywhere near here . it was really good but sadly , it did not last that long . xd
 my boys love love love this brand and this particular one ! ! except target online does sell it cheaper than even the `` subscribe and save '' price on amazon and <unknown> . some of the ella 's brand is cheaper on amazon if you do `` subscribe and save '' but check target online too , bc they give free shipping on orders % 50 or too ! !
 two-thirds the size of a soda can , so the amount of sauce you get really is n't very much at all . they make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity . the <unknown> <unknown> on the side further deceive the eye . so in summary , what we have here is a tasty sauce offered for a high price . i would recommend perhaps looking for a single bottle at your local supermarket before committing to an entire six-pack , to see if the flavor is worth the cost for you .
 the reality with the garden is that it is not easy to do so . there is only the one hood support to use . so even using garden <unknown> , velcro , etc , the plants are always <unknown> around . if <unknown> is reading this - i have a suggestion for you : use the four `` unused '' holes in the tray to hold some sort of support <unknown> for plants that get that big or need to <unknown> . there could be some sort of snap in cone or something to help hold plants up .
 this is perfect for my chewy poodle ! she 'll <unknown> over it , but only when it 's `` bone time . '' and it keeps her away from chewing on , well , everything else .
 leaf spots . ive posted this review before and i received an email from <unknown> stating please remove my review cause it hurts there business , i wasnt even offered an apology on any of the issues . then i notice that <unknown> some how has <unknown> all of the negative comments on some plants that i posted but have not <unknown> the positive comments on the other plants . so this is why they have so many five stars because they are taking out the negative comments we as customers post . ( very <unknown> of <unknown> garden )
 these are hardly deluxe or whole , i was expecting larger and more whole cashews . good price still as i just fire these things down by the handfull ... <unknown> is a little messy but nice .
 caribou coffee is an outstanding choice for k cup lovers . it comes in a variety of flavors and is the perfect start for any morning .
 if you drink 2 or more cups of coffee a day with this stuff in it , you are getting a nice big dose of trans fat and doing yourself harm . this is not a liver friendly food . eat liver friendly and you will live a long life . your liver is the filter for the body . just like a pool filter , once it gets clogged , it does n't work good . fortunately , the liver is one organ that can repair itself if you let it . remember , eat liver friendly foods .
 this product works as described . it is easy to use once you get the hang of it . users will need to develop a system for <unknown> the stuffing in order to refill the tube . i am on my third batch of sausages using this sausage <unknown> , and the only minor complaint i have is a bit of liquid leaking out during the stuffing process . overall very happy especially considering the price .
 when i opened the package , i only found 11 packets of the honey <unknown> . there should have been 12 . i counted and <unknown> 4 times to be sure . the packets were in a thin cardboard display box , wrapped in a sealed plastic bag , and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box . i do n't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item , so i guess i 'm out a pack . it 'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet ! ; - )
 this product tastes better than the original ( non-organic ) variety . the macaroni is a little bit longer than the original which makes it slightly more difficult for my toddler to eat , and the cheese takes a little more stirring to `` melt '' and incorporate in . however the great taste more than makes up for these little <unknown> and knowing it 's organic makes me happy !
 since breakfast and it kept me going . i then ordered a carton from amazon and was impressed by the crunchiness and the good flavor from the assorted nuts packed in there . if you 've never tried this product , imagine a handful of mixed nuts held together with just enough candy syrup to fill in the <unknown> < br / > < br / > one of my friends thought it was a little too hard in texture. < br / > < br / > please note the very low carbohydrate content -- good for diabetics .
 my dogs love this treat . i use it to train them and just for fun . the nice thing about this product is that if you want the pieces to be smaller , it 's easy to cut them up without it crumbling apart . also , it was a great deal .
 with fluoride , spearmint 4 oz < /a > . ( i always recommend a toothpaste with fluoride , so get the spry with fluoride - it also comes in a <unknown> formulation too ) . the flavor of this gum tends to wear off rather quickly , but then the intent is to dose the mouth with xylitol , not necessarily to promote gum chewing or gum chewing <unknown> < br / > < br / > bought in bulk , as in this package , the cost is <unknown> < br / > < br / > <unknown>
 other reviewers here that gave this bar a good review must have been paid off by thinkthin . theses are the worst tasting protein bars i 've ever tasted in my life . at least other brands try to make their bar taste alright , thinkthin basically said nope , not even going to try . the bar barely has any white chocolate taste to it . the bar is bitter and dry . it took me 30 minutes to finish 1 bar because it tasted so bad . will never buy another thinkthin product .
 bold but not bitter . as good as the k cups for a much smaller price . i wish they would make this in a decaf also .
 love the flavor , but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were <unknown> , as if they 'd been exposed to heat during filling . my husband used two of the ones that were not affected , so i 'm not returning them , but certainly wish quality control had caught this . the affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the keurig .
 it 's a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version . no mess and the s & s price is great ! i like that the box has <unknown> to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser .
 this is absolutely delicious ! my husband has had it on vanilla ice cream every night since it arrived . just the right blend of chocolate and raspberry .
 the tug - a - jug is another excellent product for a puppy that destroys most toys . while the rope was eventually destroyed , i put some little balls in the jug & my puppy still loves this product .
 an emerald nuts product ? they are always good quality nuts , and cashews are a personal weakness of mine . the seasoning is an unusual choice and may be an acquired taste . the pepper makes this snack surprisingly spicy , so if that 's not your thing , do n't try them . i believe the flavor is growing on me , though i find more than a small handful is just a bit overpowering . maybe that 's a good thing for me , as like with most nuts , this is not a low-fat snack .
 i had never experienced a cup of this heavenly stuff before ... .but wow , i love it , the smell is just amazing and the taste ... <unknown> is soooo gooood ! ! ! i am hooked on it now ! ! ! ! the tea as well ! ! ! this is a definite keeper ! ! ! i add half and half to make it rich and creamy ... : )
 i first had this bouillon in switzerland and loved it and brought some home with me . it is hands down the best vegetable bouillon - adds so much flavor to soups , vegetables and dips etc . it is organic too- yea ! i was thrilled to see that amazon carries it ! i am about to order a case now . thank you amazon !
 i had heard quite a bit about the pb2 , and being a lover of peanut butter , i thought i would try it . but , it just did n't do the trick . taste was not what i like , though the consistency was ok . i prefer <unknown> peanut butter .
 sensitive stomachs . this food has never been recalled and is made in it 's own plant , unlike most major brands out there that are manufactured at the same plant and only under different names . the price i find to be fare , as i have paid much higher for other holistic food which was not received well by my dogs. < br / > < br / > i highly recommend <unknown> natural food for anyone who really knows the <unknown> of feeding your `` companions '' healthy food and for those who really love their <unknown>
 ( not <unknown> , but <unknown> spicy ) . my kids were <unknown> by it and while my husband and i could eat it , we did n't really like it . since i bought a case , we threw away the rest of the spice packets and made our own cheese blend for the rest of the pasta . i would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can , otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family does n't like this unusual flavor .
 first if you are a vegan and use to not having cheese this may not be as bad. < br / > < br / > if you are new to gluten and casein free cheese mixes or new to vegan lifestyle you do n't need to try this. < br / > < br / > it has such a strong garlic smell that turns you off of the taste. < br / > < br / > pros : it is very easy to make
 > < br / > i didnt even bother planting the seeds . i just sprinkled them on the surface ( like in nature ) , of damp soil and covered it with a cellophane covering . they have all dug in and have jumped up. < br / > < br / > i will update this review after we try the first juice from these. < br / > < br / > overall a fantastic product , performs better than advertised ! < br / > < br / > thank you for reading my review .
 i am amazed at this product . i did n't really expect it to be as good as it is . now , if they could only come up with a way for it to be crunchy , it would be perfect ! it 's good as is ( blended with water ) and also as an addition to recipes calling for peanut butter . this is an excellent product and a great way to enjoy peanut butter without the fat .
 a really well-made cookie ( which they are ) and not like some <unknown> excuse for a cookie ( which i 'm sure you 've <unknown> if you have these dietary restrictions ) . i 've also tried sun flour baking co. 's lemon shortbread ( also sold here ) , and it is equally as satisfying . maybe the `` lots of love '' listed in the ingredients is what is doing the culinary trick here , but whatever sfbc is doing , i hope they keep it up for a very long time ! i am hooked !
 100 calories sounds great -- but only if you eat but one package . not easy to do if you 're hungry . still , it 's a convenient snack to put in a backpack , lunch box , carry-on ( now that they do n't feed you much when you fly ) , etc . with less calories than most alternatives . could also tide you over between meals . still , i 'd personally prefer something a bit healthier . but that 's why there 's chocolate & vanilla -- oops , they left out the vanilla !
 i feel guilty eating these they are so good ! moist , chewy and just sweet enough but not too sweet . i will get this again .
 i have very picky <unknown> at my <unknown> time i open a can of <unknown> venison holiday <unknown> ( springer spaniel ) and <unknown> ( cocker spaniel ) go <unknown> <unknown> it up .
 the label says `` ... has a strong rich flavor with overtones of caramel and malt . '' i call it a smoky flavor and found the perfect use for it -- bbq . now i use <unknown> brand manuka honey exclusively to make bbq tofu and chicken with a little garlic and red pepper . delicious ! ! no other honey will do .
 as someone who has not been able to eat gluten for the past couple of years , this chip brought back memories of my favorite - everything bagels - that i used to eat regularly . they are quite delicious !
 more than a proportion of <unknown> leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth . this product can not begin to compare with the taste of the <unknown> kraft 's low-carb barbecue sauce . mostly , i make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste , but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined . however , if you are on an extreme low-carb diet ( such as dr. <unknown> 's ) this may be the only product that fits .
 omg these brownies are so ridiculously delicious ! they are way too easy to make to taste this good . my only word of caution is to be careful of downing the entire tray as it <unknown> <unknown> any of the <unknown> benefit you feel from them being fat free . keep in mind , calories are calories and you will not be able to stop eating these ! < br / > < br / > p.s . i 'm not on a diet . i just buy these because they taste the best .
 it was poorly packed in a thin plastic package and included in a box with a couple of other products . as a result i got a bag of peanut butter and coconut crumbs that were smashed together and inedible . i ended up throwing the entire $ 10.00 package away . this is the first bad product i have received from amazon , normally everything is packed and sent with much consideration . why this was not packaged in a cardboard container when i receive other items double ( and sometimes triple ) packed i will never know .
 i 've tasted different rice varieties and this one is <unknown> in taste and texture . some of you may be skeptical but this special variety is short and plump but has a nice shine and not brittle when it is steamed . also the texture is smooth as you eat it along with your favorite foods . excellent for sushi . people who like their cooked rice a bit <unknown> will love this .
 do n't let the <unknown> fool you : this is not as good as <unknown> starbucks coffee . however , it is about a <unknown> times better than any other instant on the market . and it 's cheaper than any respectable <unknown> brew . well worth the $ $ $ .
 eagle pack giant breed puppy food is the only dog food i will feed my english mastiff , <unknown> . she is a happy , healthy , 120 <unknown> , 11 month old puppy . we plan to continue feeding her eagle pack gb until she is two years old .
 packaged in the box to prevent <unknown> , and the expiration dates on the boxes are n't too close - the last order i received in september , with a `` best if used by '' date of the upcoming january . although , really , i do n't think hamburger helper is terribly <unknown> < br / > < br / > this product , according to the ingredients list , contains wheat , milk , soy , and egg products , in case you might be <unknown> < br / > < br / > ~ <unknown> <unknown>
 my <unknown> love this high quality , healthy food . wellness pouches are a great food for all cats of all ages .
 another great tasting <unknown> flavor ! popchips are one of the best snack foods available these days .
 i am putting together some <unknown> type gift baskets and ordered several jars of lavender . the labels make these look like top $ < br / > boutique lavender . they look great and the lavender looks like top grade , have n't opened them as they are gifts .
 and seafood flavors < br / > delicious and <unknown> shapes made with real seafood < br / > <unknown> shapes made with the delicious taste of real chicken and turkey < br / > < br / > however , there were no <unknown> shapes , just the classic can shaped pate . so it was disappointing . no where does it say this is <unknown> < br / > < br / > also , it comes in three seafood varieties . i do n't see where the filet mignon , chicken and turkey flavors come in .
 these cups are simply little plastic container with coffee grounds ... no <unknown> at all . grounds leak out into coffee cup . terrible ! it almost seems like these are defective they are so bad . one customer posted the picture of a practically empty cup after brewing next to an actual k-cup full of coffee grounds ... yeah , because when you use <unknown> all the coffee grounds end up in your cup . do not buy !
 i 'm very satisfied with this product , mainly with the price ! i really hope they start to pack this food with bpa-free lids , this way it 'll be the best in the market for our babies . thanks !
 these crispy m & m 's do not taste like they used to when they were sold here in the u.s . these might be made with dark chocolate or something , but they taste completely different .
 this is a great brand of food . the `` kids '' were so enthusiastic about the food that they even made a point of opening the bag themselves when i was n't looking -- determined little kitties .
 the pre-measured bags are quick and convenient , but the popcorn is too salty for my taste buds . i made several batches for my daughter 's <unknown> party . some kids liked the popcorn , and some kids thought it was too salty and did n't eat it . unless you like very salty popcorn , i would look for another brand . lastly , it was n't as fresh tasting like at our local movie theatre , which uses orville redenbacher . i 'm going to google and see what orville redenbacher makes for kettle popcorn makers .
 i was so sad when they stopped producing this cereal year-round . my whole family loves it ! i was so happy to find it on amazon . it arrived yesterday ( in perfect condition ) and already one box is almost gone ! i realize it 's not exactly nutritional fare , but as a dessert , it 's the best !
 my boyfriend and i love this tea . though it does n't necessarily feel as though it `` <unknown> '' you , it certainly makes you feel clean . typically cleansing teas taste awful but the <unknown> tea has a wonderful taste . it is my favorite tea by far .
 this order so far with the first two boxes , have been very <unknown> to say the least . not like the previous order i rec 'd last year directly from < br / > the popcorn maker . i do n't know if this order sat in the warehouse for a long time or the popcorn company used an old popcorn ! !
 i have 2 german shepherds and both have very sensitive stomachs . we used to deal with diarrhea frequently . once we switched to royal canin everything got better . also , the pieces are pretty big so unlike other food the dogs ca n't just swallow these without properly chewing first . i highly recommend this food to all the german shepherd owners .
 i 've purchased this many times , and since the beginning , i 've always enjoyed it . if you follow the directions correctly , you can create a delicious <unknown> snack for the kids , or as a pasta side for dinner . i highly recommened this product .
 absolutely natural tasting maple agave . i adore real maple syrup and this measures up very , very well . highly recommended .
 < br / > < br / > be very careful with food products ordered online , you never know what somebody may have done to it along the way . in a situation where you have cause to be suspicious , as i do in this one , it 's best to just return it and hope the company gets their act <unknown> < br / > < br / > i wo n't be ordering mangoes online again , which is a shame because i really do enjoy this particular brand and ca n't find it locally .
 these are great . my kids love them and they have a great time looking at the animals . plus they are a much healthier alternative to other cookies ! buying from amazon is 1.00 cheaper than the grocery store . i even like them . the bag does n't stay around for too long though .
 has another nutrition facts sticker put there to cover or hide the original one . out of curiosity , i <unknown> off the sticker , and found the following : < br / > < br / > ingredients as : prunes , potassium sorbate as a preservative . product of usa , argentina , chile , and <unknown> < br / > < br / > so the prunes i got is not only not organic grown at ca but also contains preservative ? is it an okay practice to put another sticker on original nutrition facts label ?
 i was hoping for a `` dried '' plum ... but this is <unknown> ... definitely not what i was looking for . my dad likes them like this , so i gave them to him and he is thrilled . i 'll keep looking . that 's why three stars ... 0 from me and 5 from him .
 < br / > since i do n't drink much coffee , one cup of this has enough `` kick '' to keep me up all day long. < br / > < br / > now i drink a cup of coffee but i go running and it makes me feel like i can run much longer. < br / > < br / > so i would highly recommend this . again i was n't a two cup of coffee per day person but now 2-3 times a week , i enjoy a cup of starbucks via .
 my dogs absolutely love these bones . they are a little stinky when you first open the bag , but my dogs ca n't get enough of them ! ! ! i would definitely recommend these . your dog will thank you . : )
 especially if you doctor it up with plenty of cream and sugar , as we tend to do ) . honestly , we thought this coffee was perfect until we traveled to <unknown> and tasted real <unknown> , mountain grown coffee . after that , coming home to eight o'clock was n't so great . but if you are already drinking pre-ground coffee , and do n't have a particular brand preference , i 'm guessing you 'll be totally happy with this product . and because we 're cheap , we 're still drinking it too . : )
 i really like these nuts . i used to live by a store that carried these spicy nuts but i have since moved away . i used to drive up to the store though just to get this item since they are hard to find . i then started to buy them off of ebay , but was overjoyed when i saw them on amazon . this product is great if you like spicy food . i hand these out at work and people love them . give them a try if you like spicy stuff .
 i gave these to my husband for christmas , and we had them over the holidays . they were sooo tender and juicy ! they arrive so quickly . i am always thrilled with omaha steaks . thanks for such a wonderful product !
 the old original dentyne chewing gum is still the best . the cinnamon is good for the <unknown> system and fresh breath . dentyne has come out with many other flavors , but none are as good as the original . i ca n't understand why dentyne has made it hard to find in stores . i 've been chewing it for fifty years and will continue to do so , as long as it is made. < br / > < br / > charles , from <unknown> .
 my english bulldog ( white and <unknown> ) , american bulldog ( white and <unknown> ) and little mix breed ( tan and white ) . they all smell great and the white areas really pop . i could n't be happier . the scent lasts a little over a week ... my dogs <unknown> in their pool everyday and celebrate by rolling in the <unknown> , though , so i 'm sure it would last longer on less active dogs . lol it arrived on time and i would ( and do ) buy from this seller again .
 this coffee is good with a chocolate taste and a hint of raspberry . i think anyone that loves a chocolate taste would enjoy this one .
 belgian chocolate if sold as a bitter sweet dark chocolate , this product does not normally contain whole milk , milk solids , lactose , calcium <unknown> , milk protein or animal by products such as animal fat , animal derived protein or bulk <unknown> which alter the favor of real chocolate < br / > < br / > while this product may contain a minimum of 40 % cocoa solids ( the main <unknown> and ingredient in chocolate ) it is the best chocolate product produced in <unknown> and a true value to chocolate lovers any where !
 favorite to keep in my drink box to offer everyone a selection of tea -- the foil packages prevent taste transfer , help keep the bags clean and dry , and are clearly labeled as to the variety . i feel comfortable adding bigelow teas to our backpacks too -- the teas will be usable whether they are used this trip ... or six trips from now . convenient , fantastic flavor , high quality , and amazon offers a much better price than our local stores . i love the convenience of `` subscribe & save '' too !
 love <unknown> and have tried all sorts . the kind that come from this shipper are <unknown> <unknown> ( a nice brand ) , but instead of the 40 count advertised , only 8 arrived ( in a fancy blue tin , for which i have no need ) . the tin even has a sticker on top that says 40 count . either someone is <unknown> <unknown> , or this is just <unknown> advertised . so be aware ! this should read 8 count , not 40 ( which makes the price point pretty different ! ! ! )
 i love this tea ! ! to perfect my mornings , after brewing this tea , i add <unknown> light agave nectar and a little silk vanilla creamer -- wow . it even satisfies my sweet tooth .
 i was a bit skeptical at first when i saw the price of these papers , but as soon as i tried it out , the money was well worth it . it really does taste like grape & makes whatever you 're smoking kind of smell like grape as well . the papers themselves smell so good ! overall , a very good buy .
 taste the cheese . the texture was still a little chewy while eating after the initial crunchiness , but with a better flavor it was n't as bad . the spiciness is a little much at times , but definitely worth it for the flavor. < br / > < br / > i really did enjoy this particular flavor of <unknown> fries . and considering there are limited flavors of <unknown> snacks in my area i 'm glad i liked at least one of the flavors. < br / > < br / > review by m. reynard 2012
 it anywhere in my area . i was so glad i was able to purchase it thru amazon . i 'd like to try more products from this vendor , as their huckleberry tea is a real hit . i 'm a coffee drinker & rarely drink tea , so when i do have tea , it has to be a warm , fuzzy memorable experience . this tea has just the right balance of huckleberry flavor , & is a very good , well made product . this tea would make a wonderful gift for the tea aficionado .
 i love this stuff . i blend it into my smoothie every couple days for breakfast . it helps me feel energetic in the morning , not the weighed down , tired feeling you have after cereal or other starchy carbs . it also seems to help me lose weight , even when i 'm not trying . just a really healthy start to the day . great that it 's organic , vegetarian , soy free , dairy free , and gluten free too .
 is great . i really appreciate the <unknown> taste of the hickory marinade , with its nice hint of black pepper . i think they got it just right . there is enough spice to satisfy adult taste buds , and i do n't think the heat will overwhelm older children , but for the little ones , the teriyaki flavor is sweeter and less spicy . this is definitely a product the whole family will enjoy . now , if they would just include a small packet of dental floss in each bag , it would be perfect !
 the cashew cookie is my favorite flavor of the larabar . very tasty ! i have <unknown> 's disease and am on the <unknown> diet . since this is made strictly with nuts and fruit ( no other additives at all ) , it 's a perfect snack ! i eat a couple of these each day .
 we love kettle chips lightly salted and do n't feel guilty eating them ! we used to buy them at whole foods but buying from amazon has saved us money . we have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery .
 great cookies - none of the sugar garbage and meat by-products - our dog has been loving these for over 5 years .
 best tasting green tea around a bit pricey . i tried yogi green tea because it was cheaper it was good but not a smooth and rich <unknown> will stick with traditional medicinal from now on .
 stash is a decent brand of tea . we 've got a number of their varieties in the house . we only use loose leaf and this does n't have that tendency you sometimes get in loose leaf to be teeny tiny powder bits . you can actually tell that this was , at one time , a <unknown> < br / > < br / > it 's got a good mild flavour that is just right near bedtime .
 this snack is interesting and certainly different from the usual . i enjoyed the crunch and the taste ... in fact , i am ordering several packages of it to have on hand .
 our dog loves them , what more can i say . he searches his bowl for these when we hide them in his food .
 okay , i am eating this gum as i write this , usually i do n't review food but this is an <unknown> is a mix of stawberry and lime , it actually taste like both if not sure how but it <unknown> has a hard outer shell ( the stawberry ) but inside is the lime goop which taste very <unknown> if you are looking up gum this is the one you should try .
 i have used birds custard powder for years when making <unknown> . i am so happy to find that amazon carries this , as it 's usually not available in local grocery stores . this is my preferred custard for <unknown> . thanks , amazon !
 i used this on a london <unknown> i had grilled , and it <unknown> the meat well . many will wonder how hot it is . tough question , since i really like peppers of all kinds , but i would call it pretty mild . your taste may vary !
 the bugs out of it. < br / > < br / > this is a health and spoilage issue ... 50 # 's of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be <unknown> by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers ( very expensive and hard to find } . i am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security . long term storage is a big issue with people like me. < br / > < br / > <unknown> ( <unknown> )
 i was first introduced to the rub with love products through the salmon rub , which is one of my favorites . when my local store stopped carrying it , i looked it up on amazon , i was pleased to find the whole line of <unknown> < br / > < br / > my favorite use of the bengal masala rub is when roasting root vegetables in the oven . it 's also great on baked chicken .
 appreciate those science <unknown> out there who spent the time to create a process to take 85 % of the fat and calories out of peanut butter ! who knew that was even possible ? pb2 makes it very easy to add protein to my oatmeal , protein shakes , etc. , and saves me some of the fat and calories i used to get using regular peanut butter . it certainly does n't take the place of peanut butter in every situation , but i am thankful for this tasty option as i 'm working on getting healthier .
 just right for making <unknown> <unknown> noodles and other delicious recipes . glad to have this in my pantry . flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes . product delivery was great - just as expected .
 the price for the quantity was the best i could find online . my wife really enjoys the product so we 'll use this supplier again .
 i bought these for my two year old who has many food allergies . i bought these , hoping that he would like them and stop <unknown> the other kids cheerios , but he seems to prefer the cheerios over these . he has wheat , peanut , dairy , egg , soy , and oat allergies . the taste is ok. not bad . i did n't notice any aftertaste , so that 's good . they are a good quick snack for the car . he tends to like corn flakes over these though .
 i was very impressed with the crackers ... i have many gluten-free customers that frequent my tea house ... these are a delicious addition to our gluten-free menu we can offer them .
 the new sweet potato popchips are yummy and filling one small bag fulfilled my desire to <unknown> for the evening . i felt no guilt on my diet. < br / > good job popchips ! !
 do n't waste your money ! < br / > < br / > this product is full of a preservative that gives it a bad after taste !
 this dog food is excellent ! my shih tzu 's are thriving on it , they are healthier and full of energy , no allergy problems that <unknown> them in the past . yes it is a little more expensive , but well worth it for the health of your pups ! i highly recommend it !
 the reviews on this are so true . great idea , but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side , even once i figured it out . i keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid - but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure . i would consider buying one of the new designs that seem <unknown> and open from the top ( not the side ) .
 i was sooo excited to try this product loving pasta so much but it does not taste like pasta . very disappointed to throw out the rest < br / > < br / > <unknown>
 this was a great deal for a chocolate <unknown> , which is quite pricey , and came in a well cared for manner as well as looking very much alive . it did not come ready to bloom as stated in the details of the item but it is on its way to <unknown> and think this is a very good product for a person who knows how to take care of <unknown> .
 we love these sugar cubes in the office . they are n't your grandmother 's sugar cube . they have a rugged appearance ( can sugar cubes be considered rugged ) . and we combine them with the white sugar cubes from la <unknown> .
 these are given to my 2 rescue dogs at the end of the day . they know when it is time to go out for the last time at night and sit and wait for their greenie . all we have to say is `` do you want to brush your teeth '' and they go nuts . they love them and their teeth are in great shape ...
 we love melitta coffee pods . makes a perfect cup of coffee every time . the coffee is always delicious , even the decaf blend ! if you have a coffee pod machine , try all of their blends ... they 're great !
 i 've tried a couple of other flavors of this brand and they were great , however , this pepper flavor was over the top . way too much pepper for my taste . so much so that i could n't eat more than a couple of pieces and i do n't plan on eating any more of it .
 i have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about . i followed the directions nothing happened . brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea . on the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- i drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened ! just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else . strange .
 i did not receive this product . delivery company dropped it off <unknown> else and not in my house .
 i was so happy to see that someone realized that the kcup is a product in a lot of homes . these disposable kcups make using ground coffee a simple clean and easy way to enjoy a favorite coffee , tea or hot chocolate beverage easy i work as a <unknown> and am always searching to find the new products and making sure that i can reccomend the products to the customers and stores that i service
 about five or six years ago i used to buy mi <unknown> cookies weekly hoping that the cookies would n't add inches to my waist line . from what i <unknown> , it was really yummy but had to stop buying them because it 's expensive .
 i was so happy when i received this coffee . the flavor is perfect , and not too strong . also i like how there is minimal waste because the product is a pod of paper while other coffee machines use plastic
 wow , a brownie in a coffee cup & zero calories ! ! it 's hard to find decaf coffee with a good taste -- this product really fits the bill .
 $ <unknown> and the competitor , happy melts yogurt melts , on sale for $ 5 . i have to say , go with the happy melts version . the gerber ones lack the flavor and texture of the happy melts version and are actually kind of chalky and bland . happy melts are all organic and are smaller , which is better for your baby and for you . i prefer the strawberry flavor but the <unknown> is also quite good . i think the way they melt in your mouth is quite similar to astronaut ice cream .
 a lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients . this is pure meat ( which as a vegetarian is odd to write ) . our dogs love apples , bananas , and oranges - but love their <unknown> < br / > < br / > warning - we just moved and could n't find ziwipeak . they would n't touch anything else we bought ! seriously . they are hooked . they love it. < br / > < br / > so we are huge fans !
 i hated the flavor of this product , i ended up just giving it away at work who ended up giving it away to there friends .
 i 've been hearing about this product on hungry girl . i love peanut butter but not all that fat that goes along with it . this stuff is amazing ... .so creamy and peanutty . i also like the portion control of just mixing the amount i need . i gave one of the jars to my mom and she loves it too .
 why -- these things taste great ! < br / > < br / > i love the screw top pouches -- all i do is grab a spoon , and squeeze a mouthful size amount into the spoon and feed it to my son . i do n't need a bowl to keep the product clean from baby <unknown> < br / > < br / > if anything , when he 's done eating ( if he does n't eat the whole thing ) all we 're left with is one spoonful of food that is wasted .
 just like <unknown> original flavor <unknown> , only bigger ! ! ! ! we will probably be buying more to use for stocking stuffers and to include with birthday gifts .
 strong flavored . a tea with a `` kick . '' flavor stays with you for a long while . love it !
 i love this product ! i bought a second order a long time before i thought that i would and have signed up for subscribe and save .
 i try to be good , but when i feel like indulging in some delicious , gourmet potato chips , these new york chedder potato chips are the first flavor i like to go for , when i see them at the natural food store . the chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand .
 it is great ... my cat loves catnip and this is no exception . it will last a while and no issues with <unknown> .
 i have not met a dog yet that does not love these treats . i quit buying anything else .
 supermarket , '' and my family really liked them . that was a few years ago . now , they sit in the back of the pantry and no one <unknown> them -- either the recipe changed or my family 's tastes changed . they are dry , about half of them are broken , and they taste like sweetened cardboard . ( we have the vanilla variety . ) the individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks , but i 've noticed that they frequently come back unopened . guess i 'll look for an alternative .
 i was sent a <unknown> e-mail from amazon a couple of years ago on barbecue <unknown> , spices , sauces and rubs . that 's when i first tried bad <unknown> 's butt rub . it is the only seasoning i put on my steaks & chops now . my friends have noticed it when i have had them over for a barbecue . i 've turned several of them onto it also . it 's true , every thing goes better with a little butt rub .
 i use this product to make a great burrito just like what is made at our local taco place . i make up the mix according to package directions , but do n't add the chicken . i heat up a can of refried beans and then make burritos by putting about 1/4 cup of refried beans , 1/4 cup of the enchilada filling and a tablespoon or two of picante sauce on a flour tortilla and then rolling up burrito style . these have been a big hit every time i have served them .
 these brownies are delicious , period . i did n't even follow the instructions ( forgetting to whip the eggs before i added them ) and they turned out wonderful . if only all gluten free products tasted this great !
 , and this is just does n't measure up . it reminds me of the sugar free swiss miss . no matter what size you set your cup on , it 's just missing that cocoa flavor . maybe the dark chocolate would be better . i personally like the cafe escapes milk chocolate better ! < br / > < br / > i bought a 24 pack , and then i was able to find it at my local grocery store , so i bought another one . now , i 'm stuck with the 24 pack .
 good quality oats . package came on time . oats worked well in recipes . i will admit , as a single person i bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast <unknown> it lasted us for the year. < br / > < br / > otherwise it 's an excellent buy .
 i became addicted to eating these the first time i tasted them which was years ago . once you eat one , you just ca n't stop until they 're gone . they are n't too sweet and make the perfect snack . i love these things ! ! !
 's rejected many high-quality foods in the past . it is nice to have an alternative to the one brand . i 'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent. < br / > < br / > i do want to <unknown> that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance . that is definitely true for the pot pie flavor , but it is not true for petite cuisine in general . the pot pie is definitely made to resemble soup .
 despite the picture , these are not <unknown> brand mangoes but are a <unknown> royal brand . read the fine print . shame on this seller and shame on amazon for allowing this deceptive sales technique . do not be fooled .
 this flavor is the best of the bunch by far . i am reluctantly on a diet that allows for a few almonds as a snack . i tried these and i was hooked . unfortunately , most stores do not carry this flavor . my first case went very quickly , as every co-worker who tried them wanted a can of their own . i recommend them to anyone , not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that <unknown> us of less healthy snacks .
 this cherry juice is so yummy ! buying it here on amazon by the case is much cheaper then buying it at publix . it helps relax me and my hubby at the end of a long day . the bottles arrived earlier than expected and in perfect condition .
 these are the best tasting almonds . i buy them in bulk to share at work . any time someone finds cheaper almonds , they always come back to these because they ca n't be beat .
 greens grew fast and well . no problems . bit pricey as is all the aero refills .
 very nice cookies and amazon shipping was also fast . my kid loves them . the only thing is the price . i bought similar ones in costco before with much cheaper unit price . however , could n't find anymore in costco after xmas .
 tells you on the back how many they can have ( by dog 's weight ) daily . my two toy poodles will do just about anything , including chewing the bag open for me , to get these . except , maybe , eating their dog food dinner first . dogswell has these treats for vitality , but it also has these treats for arthritis and other problems too . and besides chicken , they also have duck breast , which my dogs are crazy about . it 's so convenient to get them thru amazon , too .
 making them much more interested in it . canola oil is a cheaper alternative , but its really not a <unknown> < br / > < br / > this is definitely something i recommend to include in your feeding rotation ! < br / > < br / > on the <unknown> : if you do not want to risk having a 15 pound bag of food that your dog hates , contact wellness for a sample ! they will send a 4oz packet to you , so you can `` test '' if your dog likes it .
 i 've ordered greenies two times now and both expire within a week of receiving them . i sent the first one back and wo n't see my money for 4-6 weeks . guess i have to do the same yet again . spend the extra dollar at the grocery store to be sure they are n't going to expire before you can use them . i do n't plan to feed my one dog 30 greenies before they expire on the 4th .
 this is a great price if you want to grow your own sprouts . saves a bundle compared to buying sprouts at the store .
 was hoping that the pieces would be a bit flatter in structure , but they shy away from sausage stick territory fine enough . flavor was n't bad , but nothing to write home about . i 'm just glad they were n't that greasy .
 good . not great , but not a problem at all . it 's considerably milder than mccormick 's . so , to compensate , depending on what i 'm making , i simply modify the quantity of spice . i use about 50 % more of this than i would with mccormick 's pp spice . in any case , this brand is so inexpensive , it 's still a good bargain . and the flavor is great ! ! ! just know that it is a little bit mild , and it will work great for you !
 after reading some of the reviews , i got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst ! no worries here . all bags are in great shape and expiration dates are n't until june . chips , at least from the first bag , taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world ! by the way , fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so , yay team !
 my dogs love them.. they are pricey for a treat tho ! < br / > i did not notice any change on their teeth <unknown> stayed the same.. even tho i gave it to my dog 2 times a day for few months . still needed to go to the vet for deep teeth cleaning .
 i am a cook and this is a special ingredient in one of our most popular salads . it really goes well on a variety of dishes , <unknown> arugula salad it just makes it have the special kick .
 this product really deserves 4 or 5 stars for the product itself . however , as others have noted , amazon has way overpriced it . the manufacturer has its own website where it is much , much cheaper .
 for this product but the chowder was only average . warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk and/or butter to blend in with the soup mix . we found the flavor to be bland and one <unknown> , even with as little as 1/2 cup of added whole milk. < br / > < br / > the package of six cans contained three dented cans . two of them were severely <unknown> on the <unknown> and had to be tossed . for this reason , we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail .
 i sent these to <unknown> in afghanistan who are <unknown> 110 degree weather so they have flavor water on the go .
 this is a great product . i have no idea why the company has discontinued it . we have a <unknown> tzu and it works great for her . i 've tried other products , but they are mushy and extremely bland . she likes this , and it does n't get her <unknown> dirty .
 these chips are nasty . i thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag , no the chips were just soaked with grease . nasty ! !
 the price is very reasonable for a case of these cookies ( 12 boxes ) , especially when you factor in the free shipping ! they arrived promptly , in perfect condition , and are delicious !
 if you 're like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible , maybe paying a $ 1 more for 24 is n't such a big deal . nutritionally its pretty meh . you could do a lot better . but its also a versatile <unknown> you can always add lots of veggies , meat , other spices , pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option . we keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves .
 i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them . they are really amazing . i love cheddar too , but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor . i recommend them .
 great flavour ! the size of container was a bit smaller than i expected . the canister itself is a flat surface but looks very nice . would make for a good finishing oil or to use in dressings .
 what a great idea ! ! ! ! my daughter love it. < br / > i do n't think is difficult to wash , i mean , is not like just toss water and that 's it ... but , come on ! ! ! ! < br / > absolutely recommend it !
 of the cookie may be the most interesting part . originated in <unknown> , they are a favorite in new york city -- 70 % of all sales come from that one city . and unlike almost any other cookie , they are only produced <unknown> -- october through april , presumably because chocolate suffers in warm <unknown> < br / > < br / > if you like s'mores , or moon pies , or nabisco 's similar product called pinwheels , you 'll like mallomars . cookie . marshmallow . chocolate . what 's not to love ?
 i love dark chocolate so newman 's own <unknown> appealed . it has a clean taste , but lacks the depth and complexity <unknown> you expect from a premium dark chocolate . i do like that it is not overly sweet -- know it would be great to bake with .
 perfect size for my toddler , but even my 5 & 6 year olds love them . great to throw in the purse or backpack for a healthy on-the-go snack .
 i was hesitant to try this because many of the reviews said that the sweetener has a strange aftertaste , but i was pleasantly surprised . i use it for tea , and it tastes just like regular sugar to me . a great substitute !
 the negative reviews of mrs <unknown> products just because it is made in china are not really valid , can not base on other companies ' poor quality control and apply to every company in the country ! there are many bad quality foods that are made in the usa that 's bad for your health , so just because it 's labeled made in usa does n't mean it is good quality . as long as a company takes pride in their quality control and not greed for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales .
 been using this at home and getting some fantastic results ! it really does make a lot of new things possible with meat if you get creative with it . i <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> 's shrimp noodles and a couple of other recipes from david <unknown> <unknown> cookbook . i 'm suprised by some of the reviews here , some of these people seem to not really have a clue what this stuff is all about !
 for the <unknown> more than 30 days after ordering , however it arrived within 2 weeks . i am using this <unknown> to make <unknown> paste : just google `` <unknown> <unknown> paste '' . i have since checked out the barry farms website , they have many quality products ( also available on amazon ) . in fact , i have already ordered two more products from them for use in <unknown> and yoghurt making . needless to say <unknown> this product <unknown> the world of barry farms , with all the good quality they have to offer .
 salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip . these ones made by kettle were very tasty and i enjoyed them thoroughly . i just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste .
 super avocado oil . worth the price as it is fresh , cold pressed , made with care . it is great on your face after washing and i use it like lotion . no <unknown> and not greasy . love it .
 these bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces . also felt very greasy . had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin .
 this energy drink tastes ok. as for the energy kick , i did n't feel any , though i remained alert . so , overall , extra money , extra calories and some questionable ingredients . for me , i prefer coca cola . however , if someone is curious about this drink , it might work for him/her , as for taste and possible buzz .
 , for me and my partner at least , the tea is as calming as alertness promoting . it is mildly stimulant , but at the same time one feels relaxed and somehow more in control. < br / > the flavor of windsor tea is much more pleasant than that of green tea and is also more complex . no wonder coca cola still uses the plant ( ? ? ) . < br / > will it still be legal next time i , an adult , decide to buy a new box ? certainly hope so .
 my cats gobble these up ... they love this treat ! i just wish the morsels were a little larger so they would chew them ! they like them so much that they just swallow them whole ! i give them 4 stars due to the size , since they do n't chew them , it does n't help prevent tartar on their teeth ... .
 these are great for our dog and the price is great on amazon.com for the large package .
 this is part of my regular order now . i love it ! i used it when i did the master cleanse and it was perfect .
 this is a great alternative to microwave popcorn . this is a quick and easy snack . it 's got a great spicy flavor .
 . signed up for the subscribe and save option . the case contained 15 ( fifteen , full sized bags ) of chips . the price per unit equals $ <unknown> per package . that is not even the cost of plain chips . if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery , this deal is a steal . so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the spicy thai chips . p.s . even if you paid the going price of $ 30.00 , you are still ahead of the curve . enjoy
 we 've been looking for this specific brand of fajita spice for a couple of years and finally found it here . very flavorful not only for mexican dishes , but for many other dishes , even rice and eggs . big burst of nice flavor .
 can not find this cereal in any stores in my area , either mainstream or <unknown> stores . love the taste ! it 's so easy to order and the price is very competitive .
 <unknown> also stand up to using with thick <unknown> < br / > < br / > also we found that michael season 's are almost entirely whole chips , whether ordered online or bought from a store , unlike <unknown> . after i watched a <unknown> sales and stock person literally crush each bag of <unknown> chips apparently so that he could get more bags into the allotted space i could understand why . michael season 's is a winner for several reasons . and with amazon , the price per bag is lower than if bought locally .
 after the purchase i found the same brand & size at a lesser price at the local grocery store , my fault for not checking the price prior to purchase .
 i ordered lucky country licorice black <unknown> 16 oz tubs ( pack of 4 ) and that is not what i received . i was sent black currant which is awful so now what do i do ?
