 i use this with sodastream to make flavored seltzer water and it tastes much better than sodastream 's brand . i have tried the vanilla , orange , and root beer and all have been great . amazon price , especially on subscription is much cheaper than sprouts ; if i recall the cost of 1 was almost double the cost of 2 on amazon .
 giving the chews out , and sit <unknown> . as each is given his chew for the night , he 'll go to his chosen spot and begin chewing on the rawhide . it 's funny to watch , but we know they are each getting enzymes they need and exercise for their teeth and gums . an excellent choice , and sold by our vet , which is the best recommendation i know . we buy ours through amazon because we 've searched the internet time and again , and only here do we find the best price .
 we have been going to a local restaurant that serve this on thursday . everyone we tried just did n't taste right or had very little broccoli . i picked this up one day at our local store . was a little suspect on just adding boiling water to this . what a big surprise . very good soup ! i added some frozen chopped broccoli , simmer . let me tell you we do not make the special trip anymore for cheddar broccoli soup . you 'll be surprise how well it taste .
 i do n't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime , but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough .
 this tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea . the taste is also pretty good . i make mine very concentrated < br / > with less than 3 ounces of hot water and i cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a towel around the whole thing < br / > and let it sit for as long as i can before i drink it .
 coconut water is often a little too salty for me , but this one is sweetened enough to satisfy my sweet tooth . even so , i 've found that it 's better with food or it can get too sweet by the end of the can . it was better with slightly spicy food ( had it with mexican food ) than with , say , a grilled steak . overall , a very good drink . i hope it 'll get <unknown> soon !
 in comparison to other products ( and pure generic <unknown> ' caffeine pills ) , the no fear energy drink offers no better <unknown> < br / > < br / > every energy formula on the market produces a different <unknown> feeling , some are clean and high grade , while others like this one seem full of hype without a super energetic effect. < br / > < br / > finally , in addition to producing a lower energy range , the taste of this formula is not too pleasing .
 when you absolutely must have your peanut butter in liquid form , this brand ca n't be <unknown> < br / > < br / > it was a <unknown> item for <unknown> in our ice cream <unknown> , and it 's perfect for shakes as well . just do n't forget to stir it up first if it 's been sitting there a while .
 i am very happy to have found this cereal . there is no cooking required , i just warm up the milk . best thing however are the ingredients which do not include sugar - just apple and banana flakes to sweeten the cereal . just pure good ingredients . it tastes great on its own , so much so that i happily finish any leftovers . heartier than the typical instant cereals and i honestly feel good about giving it to my child .
 a great product that wal-mart stopped selling . i am certainly glad amazon.com has the <unknown> to supply this product to the people who want and need it .
 i 've tried several varieties and i find the orange the best. < br / > the drink is not sweet , but when served very cold , it 's refreshing. < br / > the only draw back is the product is pricey for the quantity. < br / > < br / > i 'd also suggest the <unknown> competitive product . you get more < br / > product for a better price .
 very happy to find this product online at such a great price . i save at least $ 1.50 per bottle ordering from amazon . there was no change in the taste and quality you expect from torani . anyone who uses sugar-free knows it can be difficult to find the syrups and sometimes even more difficult to find a good selection of flavors . i will defintely continue to buy .
 two of my favorite flavors together . the chocolate is smooth and creamy and the center is a tart sweet combo . the only problem is i ca n't stop eating them until i get to the bottom of the bag and then i have to go buy more .
 i love this salt ! ! the delivery was quick , the price was reasonable and the salt imparts a wonderful flavor to everything i eat ! and , it does n't burn my tongue ! i will be using this salt for ever more !
 i love the plain coconut water no flavors ! i was having leg cramps the were killing me , and coconut water is the best for that ! i also would like to be a sales person for coconut water we do not have it here in the city of <unknown> we do not have it in any of the stores here .
 as i was <unknown> the flowers to a large glass jar , i found a huge clump of hair <unknown> in the flowers . i threw it away along with almost a cup worth of flowers . be careful before placing an order with this company .
 after tasting a bag , i decided to send a variety case to a friend for her birthday . the whole family was delighted and could n't stop raving about how delicious the healthy snacks were .
 these treats are my picky cat 's favorite . i 've tried about 8 different brands in the past and these are always the preferred kind . highly recommended !
 $ <unknown> for <unknown> ounces of water ? you have to be joking . i have to admit it is a beautiful glass bottle ( much better than those <unknown> plastic ones ) , how can you impress your friends drinking out of a plastic bottle ?
 after reading the positive reviews i was tempted to try this . dont consider buying this one or you will regret . it definitely was not fresh and on top of that it did not even taste good . honestly , just not your <unknown> worth .
 i ca n't make a pot of coffee worth drinking . in fact , any coffee that has been sitting in a container tastes off to me . coffee from a stand or cafe is awesome , but expensive . via is a decent single cup of coffee , easy to make , tastes good . drinkable . it 's made from real ground coffee , so that makes it much better than instant . with some cream , i almost think i am having one of those expensive lattes from a coffee stand .
 get rid of them to no avail . i saw this product being reviewed in a gardener 's video blog , and thought <unknown> not ? ' < br / > < br / > within hours those pesky gnats were getting stuck , and over the course of a week , have traps filled with these pests . we 've definitely had a decrease in gnats flying around in our faces when we 're trying to watch tv . now we just need a solution to kill the larvae , so we can end their life cycle completely .
 this is a totally different flavor of reeses ! i tried them a few years ago when they first came out and i have been hooked ! they are the best when they are good and fresh ! i agree with jean - i really do n't like the regular reese 's cups anymore . you simply must try them . the only problem is that it is hard to find them .
 the seller was prompt to respond after i returned the <unknown> < br / > we could not use them because the fragrance was too strong. < br / > can be right for someone else .
 this was about the <unknown> meal i have ever prepared for my family . nobody ate more than a few bites . i love indian food . i love curry , i love chicken . this is really , really bad .
 my daughters pediatrician recommended a b concentrated <unknown> . we like the vegan vitamins because of the minimal ingredient list and the natural ingredients . our daughter loves taking them too . chewy and tasty ...
 like the cheddar potato the best . second in line is the sour cream , and third is the bbq . i recently bought 12 bags of cheddar on amazon ! < br / > these are much better than those baked chips out on the market ( in my opinion ) . oh , and an fyi , these are way better than rice <unknown> keep comparing the two and i totally disagree ) . < br / > the <unknown> oz bag is perfect single size ( pretty generous actually ) . < br / > yummy !
 my tongue hurts . just ate my first haribo gummy bears and now my tongue hurts and has several raised sores on the end of it . shocked , i read the packaging and noticed that they have artificial flavors and colors . yuck . if i 'd known that , i would not have purchased them . i see now that this information is on the amazon website , but i guess i was <unknown> away by all the good reviews and did n't read it carefully enough . ouch .
 powder , natural flavor , citric acid ) , sugar , and annatto ( natural color ) . they contain no fiber nor vitamin a , which i would expect to find in a sweet potato product. < br / > < br / > all in all , the sweet potato popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods . obviously , something along the lines of an apple or some plain popcorn would be a healthier choice for a snack , but certainly would not be as enjoyable !
 i really enjoy this coffee - i have used a variety of the k-cups and this is one of the best .
 loves them , however they do n't love her back . it took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together . finally after a google search , i came across these reviews . i stopped giving her the treats and so far , my cat has been vomit free . buyer beware , this might not happen with every cat , so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly . back to her `` greenies '' i go ! !
 had previously used lavender oil by now . sorry i bought this brand , wo n't do it again . it 's much thinner than anything else i 've used .
 my red velvet cake recipe was costing me about 8 dollars a cake in red food coloring . things were getting out of hand fast . this is saving me a ton of money . a great way to buy food <unknown> < br / > < br / > the product itself gives a beautiful color and does n't seem to impart any additional flavor .
 his house . he forgot that the package was for him , and once he opened it he was delighted to find a weeks worth of these yummy cookies ! normally he would be stocking up on the girl scout thin mints this time of year , but he is delighted to find that keebler has a similar product for so much cheaper and available all year . he is now joking that the serving size is a box instead of a sleeve ! < br / > < br / > apparently these taste amazing with peanut butter .
 great taste , very juicy . few , if any stems . i usually get the <unknown> <unknown> , but my last batch was a little too dried out .
 i love the breakfast blend because it is not real strong and does not have a bitter taste . another great blend is the nantucket blend .
 i had no idea what real <unknown> spice was until now . up to this point i had only purchased supermarket brands which pale in comparison . the minute you see the bottle and open it to smell the spices inside you 'll see what i mean . my corned beef has never tasted so good !
 one of my favorite bold flavors . many of the k-cups are too weak for us , including the flavored varieties . if you like a stronger cup of coffee than this one is for you !
 very happy with it . my husband and i use herbs from it frequently . it produces so much we have had to trim and freeze some of the leaves for later use .
 < br / > 5th bold blazin buffalo wing < br / > 6th blue diamond almonds cinnamon brown sugar < br / > 7th blue diamond almonds lime `n chili < br / > 8th blue diamond almonds smokehouse < br / > 9th bold wasabi & soy sauce < br / > < br / > but that 's just me : you might have a completely different take on these flavors. < br / > 4th and 5th are very close. < br / > < br / > gunner < br / > may , 2012
 san francisco bay coffee fog chaser one cup for keurig k-cup brewers is a very nice complement to the keurig green mountain selections . i am now on my computer with a nice hot cup of the fog chaser at my side . i like the fact that there are eight cups to an air tight bag , and that there is an external plastic container for storage after you open one of these bags . a very nice option which i will again use for future purchases .
 holy barf bag , the jalapeno popchips are foul . i love the original popchips and i really love jalapeno , but for some reason the popchips people just could n't get the flavor right . i tried one , gagged , and handed the bag off to my dad to try . he was munching cautiously when i mentioned i thought they tasted a bit like garbage . he paused , considered , and said , `` that 's it . that 's the taste . there 's something <unknown> about it . '' save your money !
 this tea is great , a contrast in flavor with the strength of black tea and the sweetness of peach good hot or iced .
 to give truvia a shot . perhaps truvia is healthier and more natural , but the taste <unknown> my coffee . it has a slight <unknown> taste which i ca n't stand . i 'm going to try a few other <unknown> sweeteners with the hopes of finding something without an aftertaste. < br / > < br / > edit : just tried truvia and there 's no <unknown> truvia wins , hands down . it 's much more similar to sugar , in both taste and texture . it 's more expensive but well worth the cost .
 these blueberries are delicious . i just wish they sold an alternate version without sugar or oil . blueberries should n't need sugar or , at least , i prefer them that way. < br / > shipping time was reasonably quick . it seemed slow to me just because i was anxious to get them ! < br / > reasonable price , too .
 seeds are excellent and it grows at my <unknown> . it is very easy to grow as long as you have soft surface . you should buy this seeds and cheap too .
 i wish i read the reviews closer before feeding these to my dogs . these are made in china and you can draw your own <unknown> .
 i thought the dinosaur would be an interesting change of pace for my dog . he immediately loved the <unknown> . he loves it . but , he was able to chew the head off in less than a week . the main body is still holding up .
 and it took half the can to get anything like a coffee flavor with the sugars -- cafe vienna is my <unknown> < br / > < br / > now , a heaping spoonful ( or two , but instead of six ) of vienna with a packet of taster 's choice and voila ' , i 'm back in europe ! < br / > < br / > also works with instant <unknown> to take the sugary edge off. < br / > < br / > i 'm defintely buying more when i run out .
 these were pretty good but the 2 oz ones taste better . maybe i just got a bad box of these though . still great protein and energy .
 my parents loved them. < br / > < br / > it is not too sweet and small ! < br / > < br / > when i put in yogurt and pancake , it 's my <unknown> !
 i live in the south and must be honest when i say that this tea is much better than even the local restaurants can make . it is sweet without being overly <unknown> . i did find out that i have to stir it a little more than i would a regular cup of tea that is warm . but , that is probably to be expected . it is good !
 the coffee is ok , nothing special . i will like to find this product at a better price .
 this coffee is about what you might get at your local 7-11 or <unknown> gas station . not <unknown> good ... and not what i would consider premium coffee . if you normally drink folgers or maxwell <unknown> this a try. < br / > if starbucks is more your <unknown> something else .
 tastes like regular pasta - much better than the <unknown> versions from other brands . much more filling than regular pasta because of the quinoa .
 a coworker brought this <unknown> into the office and i am so greatful . i am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my `` much yum '' category .
 all of a sudden this tea is no longer on the supermarket shelves . luckily i was able to get it on amazon. < br / > i will buy more since i think this is the best tasting tea there is and i do n't have to add lemon which causes too much acid in my system . this tea is smooth , not bitter and i will not drink any other tea .
 i love this powdered peanut butter . my boyfriend and i are peanut butter freaks so we were a little skeptical . it takes exactly like regular peanut butter but with out all the fat and calories . i use it with my body by <unknown> shakes to make the chocolate peanut butter cup recipe.. but you can use it anywhere you would normally use regular peanut butter .
 not worth the price ! ! ! has a very bitter taste ! ! ! ! ! you have to add a ton of honey to it to make it worth a damn . does not help coat the throat in anyway ! ! ! ! ! !
 all of the potential my hair has ever had ! '' but it was n't bad . my biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent . i 'm not sure how to explain it , but the scent seems a little chemical to me . it reminds me of a very faint version of the way your hair smells after a <unknown> < br / > < br / > this product is n't so bad that i wo n't eventually finish the bottle , but it 's not something i plan on purchasing in the future .
 one sells it for 5.99 , yet the warehouse <unknown> that is the retail price . am i missing something here ? how many hundreds of dollars have i wasted ? ? ? i guess it is a matter of what the market will bear ... <unknown> ! of course there is the additional shipping <unknown> on principal alone i will give up on this product . the greed is beyond <unknown> < br / > < br / > i gave the product a low rating , even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly overpriced .
 i think the taste was great , the ingredients are premium ingredients , and they are extremely easy to carry around . the only reason i did n't give 5 stars were because i feel like they should have fewer nuts . other than that , i love them ! : )
 please do not send the salmon as baby will no eat it , please send the chicken on happybaby organic baby food . i am to received this once a month. < br / > < br / > <unknown> <unknown>
 this fruit and nut bar by kind is very , very tasty . travels well , even in the heat . no problem with melting or not being able to handle due to the heat . nuts do require chewing so would not recommend them to anyone with chewing issues ... otherwise , they are superb .
 the belts themselves have a really off putting plastic flavor that comes as a part of the watermelon flavoring . if you get it you 'll know what i mean . none of the other sour power belts have this taste , it literally tastes like plastic and watermelon perfume compressed themselves into a belt and rolled in sour power powder. < br / > < br / > i love sour power as much as everyone , but next time i buy a huge tub ( probably quite soon ) , it 'll be of any other flavor .
 ) to enjoy it . i did not like the aluminum can for this product either . i find that <unknown> drinks seem to <unknown> onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks. < br / > < br / > my personal preference was for the black cherry , but others may like the kiwi berry . i ca n't recommend this as a net positive , but my preferences might adversely reflect here - i 'll rate it as neutral . if you feel your tastes are similar to mine , you should probably <unknown> this one .
 a lot of reviews , but this bread is just outstanding in every way . this <unknown> does n't feel or taste low carb , and it made some really good french toast . the shipping cost is high ( i chose expedited ) , but maybe if i buy enough at a time next order and freeze it i can make it less costly ... but lets face it , good bread that is low carb is worth every penny to those of us that must watch the carbs , but love bread . well done , folks .
 my girl ( amber ) just loves her <unknown> <unknown> where i keep them and lets me know when she wants one .
 why eat regular potato chips , when you can eat pop chips . the bbq flavor gets boring pretty quickly , so do n't eat a whole lot in a few days .
 these are about $ 1.50 to $ 2.50 in the store , so i was pleased to find them on subscribe and save for $ 1.50 each or cheaper . good quality , sturdy enough to toss in a purse or backpack , and pleasantly sweet without being overwhelming . good substitute for candy when i want a treat . filling enough to hold me several hours when i 'm on the go .
 i 've tried a lot of the sobe <unknown> and have to say blackberry grape is my favorite . the others seem to have very light flavors , like drinking water . but this one is very flavorful .
 based in houston , texas makes this awesome black bean dip . it is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it . i am not sure why in dallas tx it 's so hard to find - maybe because <unknown> has so many good flavors ? ? ? i make the traditional <unknown> dip with this instead of the refried beans , and am thinking about creating a breakfast <unknown> with this and some <unknown> sauce . try it , it 's not too too spicy but is very good !
 combination of spices , including cinnamon , ginger , allspice , nutmeg , clove , and cardamom . the combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy ( not as spicy as regular chai tea ) . you can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai , but i prefer to drink it plain , as i think it 's perfect as is . finally , the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes stash chai green tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day -- highly recommended !
 i purchased <unknown> gourmet popcorn , pecan & <unknown> caramel corn , 8-ounce bags ( pack of 6 ) for a gift i was sooo <unknown> it was so stale no one ( even the kids ) could or would eat it . you can not return it so i am out the money . do not purchase ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
 i think these are a bit boring ( i like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably <unknown> ) but they do <unknown> taste like peas , and my toddler begs for them ( `` peas ! peas ! '' ) . i suspect she likes the crunchiness . i bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi-pack today . i think they 'd probably be good in homemade trail mix , too .
 i 'm a meat eater , my wife 's vegetarian . she picked some of this veggie burger mix up to try , and we both really like it ! i 'm not saying it tastes like beef , but i do n't believe it 's supposed to . it 's really good ! and i 'd recommend it to anyone : )
 saw it at <unknown> . at there unlike amazon it was only $ 3.00 . it was worth buying after i tryed it out . taste like a fortune cookie with vanilla filling inside of it . love it and yes would highly recommed .
 to be vets to help them go through school . then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness . read the back of the labels of hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers , bones , unwanted organs from animals , basically all of the stuff we would n't eat . please try another brand like orijen or evo . your cat will thank you .
 the coconut water i received was exactly as expected . packaging could have been a little bit better as the bottles were all loose in the box .
 few tries but she is very food motivated and now can empty one in about an hour or so . the advice to fill it more than half full on the first go is good . in all , i like this toy , because it 's harder and requires more time and effort from a dog that the typical treat dispenser , which is good if you want to give you dog something to occupy her . if you are looking for a first <unknown> toy , i would recommend getting the twist n treat first , however .
 i did like this product until some jars i found black mold on the inner <unknown> < br / > < br / > i read other reviews , but i thought it must 've been a bad batch . i was wrong. < br / > < br / > earth 's best used to be very good . so i canceled my next subscribe and save order . then i feedback cancel reason to amazon .
 we must have this tea now ... keep a pitcher in the fridge at all times . it is a great way to get your green tea in everyday , and is refreshing with a heavy meal .
 > even my little chihuahua , cookie , does great on it . beautiful , soft and full coat , nice teeth , breath , stool and overall health. < br / > < br / > i do feed this as 70 % of their overall diet , the other 30 % being from the honest kitchen ( <unknown> and love formulas ) . < br / > < br / > this is a food i 've happily recommended ! and i do n't see myself feeding anything else . pleased with the customer service as well !
 gold bears are just what you get . these are great gummy bears . i plan on buying them again .
 we have been on gluten free for a few months now , and when you first start , many things are hit or miss . i do n't usually like vanilla `` oreo '' type cookies anyway , and worried that my boys ( 6 and 4 years old ) would never go for them ... <unknown> they are so sweet , <unknown> , and delicious that our whole family ( my husband included ) could n't get enough of them. < br / > buy these cookies , for real .
 as with most of the reviews here my tins arrived with 75 % or more of the wafers crushed . we ended up using a spoon to eat the crumbs of the 1st tin we opened . <unknown> delicious but i can not imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you can not avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available . what a mess . if these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2 .
 i 've tried unsweetened , shredded coconut from various health food stores , etc . this is the best & much cheaper than at health food stores .
 i purchased these `` dried blueberries '' , but they are n't what i expected . the blueberries are coated with sugar and sunflower oil . they are really <unknown> < br / > < br / > while the price was attractive , i feel this product is mislabeled . it should be labeled , `` candied dried blueberries '' .
 hoping for a fruity flavor , but instead it tastes just like cough syrup . i do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child , so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine , i can not drink it . i tried to drink it anyways , thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor , but i just could n't do it ! well , that is just my 2 cents . if anyone else has tried this and agrees with me , let me know !
 it makes me happy to get out of bed and have my sumatra coffee . when you brew this coffee , it has a `` head '' on it when it comes out of the keurig spout , it is just like the smell at the <unknown> store , and also has that very fresh taste . i have found that most of the kcups are either crazy weak , or just too acidic for my taste ... i swear , thank goodness <unknown> finally got in the kcup game . no , i do not work for <unknown> .
 i 've had some good <unknown> <unknown> in my day , but nothing does the trick like these candies . perfect for <unknown> and the best gift for the family <unknown> <unknown>
 begin coughing , so they are n't something i 'll be continuing to eat . but for most people , that would n't be a problem . you can even use them to grow sprouts if you 'd prefer something more <unknown> . those who grow the sprouts say that they make tiny little sprouts , but good to eat . i grew a `` chia pet '' years ago , but do n't remember what the sprouts looked like . i do remember that they sprouted easily , so that should n't be a problem for <unknown> <unknown> .
 popchips are the bomb ! ! i use the parmesan garlic to scoop up cottage cheese as a healthy alternative to chips and dip . my healthy eating program is saved .
 these gave me a headache , too much sugar , and other ingredients that did n't sit well . i would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier .
 the quality of this brand was very very good . i really enjoyed three of the six but the other three were bland . the three i liked were a little less spicy then i would eat but made for the <unknown> ... . i bought a 6 pack the the kidney bean curry and spice it up to my liking and it 's great .
 <unknown> with no refined carbs ! hallelujah ! good texture , takes on flavor of sauce , quick shipment . this is a great option for adding to an <unknown> dish . will re-order .
 , or an aggressive <unknown> < br / > < br / > definitely do not leave your dog alone with the toy . ( this should go without <unknown> ... ) < br / > < br / > would i recommend the toy ? maybe . i think it would be ideal for medium sized dogs that are n't too smart for their own good . ( if your dog can unscrew things , open doors , <unknown> , <unknown> you may want to go for a more challenging toy . i wish i had of . )
 tastes like regular wheat pasta . my kids love all their varieties of pasta , especially the spaghetti .
 the pepper is great ! ! plan on using it to keep squirrels off of <unknown> , but will try it for cooking also . price was great . one note though , product is pictured in a jar and although it says packaging may be different , it should say sold in pouches somewhere . i thought i was getting a jar .
 such a great tea , glad to see it on amazon since my local grocers do n't carry it . totally agree with the other reviewers about how yummy it is. < br / > i love it iced , but my <unknown> likes it hot when he visits .
