I
prefer

Doggy
Treat
!

Snapped
up

treat

Nutritious
,

pretty
hard
and
my

is
n't
too
excited
about
them

Probably
more
suited
for
medium
to
large
dogs

Shocked
that
my

chose
this
over
her
favorite
treat

Not
bad
at
all
...

Great

noisy
and

fall
fast

Dog
gets
distracted
by
the
treats

Less

12
hours
to
chew
up

making
it
useless

Great

of

good

I
would
n't
describe
it
as
either
``
Blazin
'
''

Not

Not
Bad

Taste

strange
...
.

Blue

The

Good

it
's

More
than
